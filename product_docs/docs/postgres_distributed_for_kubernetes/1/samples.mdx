!!! Important
    The available examples are for demonstration and
    experimentation purposes only.

These examples are configuration files for setting up
your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster in a Kubernetes environment.

## Basics

**Flexible 3 regions**
:  [`flexible_3regions.yaml`](../samples/flexible_3regions.yaml)
 : provides a PGD cluster with two data groups and a global witness node spread across three
  regions, where each data group consists of two data nodes and a local witness
  node.

**Flexible 3 regions using physical join**
:  [`flexible_3regions_physical_join.yaml`](../samples/flexible_3regions_physical_join.yaml)
 : provides a PGD cluster with two data groups and a global witness node just like `Flexible 3 regions`.
  The difference is the group join in this sample is using physical join.
  Group region-a is the first group to startup (`spec.pgd.parentGroup.create=true`), nodes in region-a join
  with each other using physical join. Group region-b define its `spec.pgd.groupJoinMethod=physical`, which means
  the first node in region-b will start and physical join a remote node, the join target is defined in
  `spec.pgd.discovery` section of group region-b, The rest node in region-b will join with each using
  physical join as `spec.cnp.joinMethod=physical`. region-c is a witness group which will always use logical join.

**Flexible 3 regions with pre-provisioned client secrets**
:  [`flexible_3regions_provisioned_secrets.yaml`](../samples/flexible_3regions_provisioned_secrets.yaml)
:  provides a PGD cluster with two data groups and a global witness node just like `Flexible 3 regions`.
  In each PGD group, the server TLS certificate is managed by the operator and cert-manager. The
  client replication certificate is pre-provisioned. Here are the steps to set up this sample:

1.  Establish the self-signed issuer and certificate in target namespace. Since we are using a pre-provisioned
    client replication certificate, we can delete the client secrets, certificate, and issuer created by
    `issuer-selfsigned.yaml`.

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f issuer-selfsigned.yaml
kubectl -n <namespace> delete secrets/client-ca-key-pair \
    certificate/client-ca \
    issuer/client-ca-issuer
```

2.  Create the PGD group. The pre-provisioned client certificate and its CA certificate are
    included in the `flexible_3regions_previsioned_secrets.yaml` file as well.

```sh
kubectl -n <namespace> apply -f flexible_3regions_previsioned_secrets.yaml
```

**Flexible 3 regions in different namespaces**
:  [`flexible_3regions_3ns.yaml`](../samples/flexible_3regions_3ns.yaml)
:  provides a sample that builds upon the `Flexible 3 regions` example.
  Each region is assigned
  a different namespace. The `discovery` and `connectivity` section are changed
  in accordance with the namespaces. To setup this sample, we need to pre-create the
  `client-ca-key-pair` and `server-ca-key-pair` secrets in each namespace utilizing
  private keys generated with the ECDSA algorithm. This ensures that the server TLS certificates
  and client replication certificates generated by `cert-manager` are signed from the same
  private key.

-   Create the namespaces `region-a`, `region-b` and `region-c`.
-   Create the CA secrets using [issuer-ecdsa-key.yaml](../samples/issuer-ecdsa-key.yaml) in each namespace for the certificates.

```sh
kubectl -n region-a apply -f issuer-ecdsa-key.yaml
kubectl -n region-b apply -f issuer-ecdsa-key.yaml
kubectl -n region-c apply -f issuer-ecdsa-key.yaml
```

-   Create the self-signed issuer and corresponding certificate in each namespace. The CA secrets
    `client-ca-key-pair` and `server-ca-key-pair` will be refreshed with `ca.crt`.

```sh
kubectl -n region-a apply -f issuer-selfsigned.yaml
kubectl -n region-b apply -f issuer-selfsigned.yaml
kubectl -n region-c apply -f issuer-selfsigned.yaml
```

-   Create the PGD group

```sh
kubectl apply -f flexible_3regions_3ns.yaml
```

**parted group cleanup**
:  [`flexible_cleanup.yaml`](../samples/flexible_cleanup.yaml)
:  provides a sample of using PGDGroupCleanup to clean up the metadata of `region-b`. The cleanup
  is run from `region-a`. All nodes belonging to `region-b` need to be in `PARTED` status
  before running this CR.

## Backup and Restore

**sample group with two schedulers**
:  [`group_example_with_2schedulers.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_2schedulers.yaml)
:  provides a PGD group sample with two scheduled backups configured:
  one using volumeSnapshot, the other using barmanObjectStore.

**sample group with backup and restore using `barmanObjectStore`**
:  [`group_example_with_barman_backup.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_barman_backup.yaml)
:  provides a backup sample for a three-node PGD group. This setup includes
  scheduled backups and continuous WAL archiving to barmanObjectStore.

:  [`group_example_with_barman_restore.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_barman_restore.yaml)
:  offers a restore sample for three regions PGD groups.
  In the first region, group
  `group-example-with-barman-restore-a` is restored from backups, and parent group `world`
  is created in this group. In the second and third region, group `group-example-with-barman-restore-b`
  and `group-example-with-barman-restore-c` are created from scratch, and respectively join the
  restored group.

**sample group with backup and restore using `volumeSnapshot`**
:  [`group_example_with_vs_backup.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_vs_backup.yaml)
:  specifies a three-node PGD group configured with scheduled volume snapshot backup
  and continuous WAL archiving to barmanObjectStore.

:  [`group_example_with_vs_restore.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_vs_restore.yaml)
:  defines full restore from volume snapshot backup.

:  [`group_example_with_vs_pitr.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_vs_pitr.yaml)
:  defines restore from volume snapshot backup followed by point-in-time recovery.

!!! Note
    The `volumeSnapshot` sample above utilizes the `csi-hostpath-sc` storage class.
    Please verify that your storage class supports volume snapshots. For more details, refer to [Backup on volume snapshots](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_volumesnapshot).

## Read node routing

**sample group with read node routing enabled**
:  [`group_example_with_readnode.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_readnode.yaml)
:  offers a sample with read node routing enabled.

## LDAP

**sample group use ldap with bind and search**
:  [`group_example_with_ldap_bind_search.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_ldap_bind_search.yaml)
:  provides an LDAP sample of PGD group configured to use `bind` and `search` for authentication.

**sample group use ldap with simple bind**
:  [`group_example_with_ldap_simple_bind.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_ldap_simple_bind.yaml)
:  provides an LDAP sample of PGD group to use simple bind for authentication.

## Managed roles

**sample group with managed roles**
:  [`group_example_with_managed.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_managed.yaml)
:  provides a PGD group sample with managed roles and managed services.

## TDE

**sample group using tde**
:  [`group_example_with_tde.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_tde.yaml)
:  provides a PGD group sample with TDE enabled. Since TDE requires PostgreSQL
  to be a specific flavor and version, the YAML file includes configurations for both
  the PGD and PGD proxy images.

## Configurations

**sample group with mutations**
: [`group_example_with_mutations.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_mutations.yaml)
: offers a PGD group sample with `always` mutation configured.

**sample group with service template configured**
: [`group_example_with_service_template.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_service_template.yaml)
:  offers a sample with `groupSeviceTemplate`, `nodeServiceTemplate` `proxyServiceTemplate`
  and `proxyReadServiceTemplate` configured.

**sample group with operand image customized**
: [`group_example_customized.yaml`](../samples/group_example_customized.yaml)
: offers a PGD group sample with pgd and proxy image name customized.

**sample group with operand image customized using ImageCatalog**
: [`group_example_catalog.yaml`](../samples/group_example_catalog.yaml)
: offers a PGD group sample with pgd and proxy image customized using ImageCatalog.

**sample group with scale up using physical join**
: [`group_example_with_physical_join.yaml`](../samples/group_example_with_physical_join.yaml)
: offers a PGD group sample with physical join configured.

For a list of available options, see the ["API Reference" page](pg4k-pgd.v1beta1.md).

!!! Note
    The PGD group sample above requires cert-manager with a self-signed issuer.
    You can use [issuer-selfsigned.yaml](../samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml)
    to create the self-signed issuer before setting up the PGD group.
