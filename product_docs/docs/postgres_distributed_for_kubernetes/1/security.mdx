Security for EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is
analyzed at three layers: code, container, and cluster.

!!! Warning
    In addition to security practices described here, you must
    perform regular InfoSec duties on your Kubernetes cluster. 
    Familiarize yourself with [Overview of Cloud Native Security](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/overview/)
    in the Kubernetes documentation.

!!! Seealso "About the 4C's Security Model"
    See [The 4C's Security Model in Kubernetes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/4cs-security-model-kubernetes)
    blog article for a better understanding and context of the approach EDB
    takes with security in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

## Code

Source code of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is systematically scanned for static analysis purposes,
including security problems. EDB uses a popular open-source linter for Go called
[GolangCI-Lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) directly in the CI/CD pipeline.
GolangCI-Lint can run several linters on the same source code.

One of these is [Golang Security Checker](https://github.com/securego/gosec), or `gosec`.
`gosec` is a linter that scans the abstract syntactic tree of the source against a set of rules aimed at discovering well-known vulnerabilities, threats, and weaknesses hidden in
the code. These threads include hard-coded credentials, integer overflows, SQL injections, and others.

!!! Important
    A failure in the static code analysis phase of the CI/CD pipeline is a blocker
    for the entire delivery of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, meaning that each commit is validated
    against all the linters defined by GolangCI-Lint.

## Container

Every container image that's part of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is built by way of CI/CD pipelines following every commit.
Such images include not only those of the operator but also of the operands, specifically every supported PostgreSQL version.
In the pipelines, images are scanned with:

-   [Dockle](https://github.com/goodwithtech/dockle) for best practices in terms
    of the container build process
-   [Clair](https://github.com/quay/clair) for vulnerabilities found in both the
    underlying operating system and libraries and applications that they run

!!! Important
    All operand images are rebuilt once a day by our pipelines in case
    of security updates at the base image and package level, providing patch level updates
    for the container images that EDB distributes.

The following guidelines and frameworks were taken into account for container-level security:

-   The [Container Image Creation and Deployment Guide](https://dl.dod.cyber.mil/wp-content/uploads/devsecops/pdf/DevSecOps_Enterprise_Container_Image_Creation_and_Deployment_Guide_2.6-Public-Release.pdf),
    developed by the Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD)
-   The [CIS Benchmark for Docker](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/),
    developed by the Center for Internet Security (CIS)

!!! Seealso "About the container-level security"
    See the [Security and Containers in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/security-and-containers-cloud-native-postgresql)
    blog article for more information about the approach that EDB takes on
    security at the container level in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

## Cluster

Security at the cluster level takes into account all Kubernetes components that
form both the control plane and the nodes as well as the applications that run in
the cluster, including PostgreSQL.

### Role-based access control (RBAC)

The operator interacts with the Kubernetes API server with a dedicated service
account called pgd-operator-controller-manager. In Kubernetes this account is installed
by default in the `pgd-operator-system` namespace. A cluster role
binds between this service account and the pgd-operator-controller-manager
cluster role that defines the set of rules, resources, and verbs granted to the operator.

RedHat OpenShift directly manages the operator RBAC entities by way of [Operator
Lifecycle
Manager (OLM)](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.13/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html). OLM 
allows you to grant permissions only where they're required,
implementing the principle of least privilege.

!!! Important
    These permissions are exclusively reserved for the operator's service
    account to interact with the Kubernetes API server.  They aren't directly
    accessible by the users of the operator that interact only with `PGDGroup`
    and `PGDGroupCleanup` resources.

The following are some examples and, most importantly, the reasons why
EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires full or partial management of standard Kubernetes
namespaced resources.

`jobs`
: The operator needs to handle jobs to manage different `PGDGroup` phases.

`poddisruptionbudgets`
: The operator uses pod disruption budgets to make sure enough PGD nodes
  are kept active during maintenance operations.

`pods`
: The operator needs to manage PGD nodes as a `Cluster` resource.

`secrets`
: Unless you provide certificates and passwords to your data nodes,
  the operator adopts the "convention over configuration" paradigm by
  self-provisioning random-generated passwords and TLS certificates and by
  storing them in secrets.

`serviceaccounts`
: The operator needs to create a service account to
  enable the `PGDGroup` recovery job to retrieve the backup objects from
  the object store where they reside.

`services`
: The operator needs to control network access to the PGD cluster
  from applications and properly manage
  failover/switchover operations in an automated way.

`statefulsets`
: The operator needs to manage PGD proxies.

`validatingwebhookconfigurations` and `mutatingwebhookconfigurations`
: The operator injects its self-signed webhook CA into both webhook
  configurations, which are needed to validate and mutate all the resources it
  manages. For more details, see the
  [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/extensible-admission-controllers/).

To see all the permissions required by the operator, you can run `kubectl
describe clusterrole pgd-operator-manager-role`.

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes internally manages the PGD nodes using the `Cluster` resource as defined by EDB Postgres
for Kubernetes. See the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/security/)
for the list of permissions used by the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator service account.

### Calls to the API server made by the instance manager

The instance manager, which is the entry point of the operand container, needs
to make some calls to the Kubernetes API server to ensure that the status of
some resources is correctly updated and to access the config maps and secrets
that are associated with that Postgres cluster. Such calls are performed through
a dedicated `ServiceAccount` created by the operator that shares the same
PostgreSQL `Cluster` resource name.

!!! Important
    The operand can access only a specific and limited subset of resources
    through the API server. A service account is the recommended way to access the API server from within a pod. See the 
    [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/access-api-from-pod/) for details.

See the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/security/)
for more information on the instance manager.

### Pod security policies

A [pod security policy](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/policy/pod-security-policy/)
is the Kubernetes way to define security rules and specifications that a pod needs to meet
to run in a cluster.
For InfoSec reasons, every Kubernetes platform must implement them.

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes doesn't require privileged mode for containers execution.
The PostgreSQL containers run as the postgres system user. No component requires running as root.

Likewise, volumes access doesn't require privileged mode or root privileges.
Proper permissions must be assigned by the Kubernetes platform or administrators.
The PostgreSQL containers run with a read-only root filesystem, that is, no writable layer.

The operator explicitly sets the required security contexts.

On Red Hat OpenShift, Cloud Native PostgreSQL runs in the `restricted` security context constraint,
the most restrictive one. The goal is to limit the execution of a pod to a namespace allocated UID
and SELinux context.

!!! Seealso "Security Context Constraints in OpenShift"
    For more information on security context constraints (SCC) in
    OpenShift, see the
    [Managing SCC in OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/blog/managing-sccs-in-openshift)
    article.

!!! Warning "Security context constraints and namespaces"
    As stated in the [Openshift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/authentication/managing-security-context-constraints.html#role-based-access-to-ssc_configuring-internal-oauth),
    SCCs aren't applied in the default namespaces (`default`, `kube-system`,
    `kube-public`, `openshift-node`, `openshift-infra`, `openshift`). Don't use them
    to run pods. CNP clusters deployed in those namespaces
    will be unable to start due to missing SCCs.

<!-- TODO: this section need to be rewritten.

### Network Policies

The pods created by the `Cluster` resource can be controlled by Kubernetes
[network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
to enable/disable inbound and outbound network access at IP and TCP level.
You can find more information in the [networking document](networking.md).

!!! Important
    The operator needs to communicate to each instance on TCP port 8000
    to get information about the status of the PostgreSQL server. Please
    make sure you keep this in mind in case you add any network policy,
    and refer to the "Exposed Ports" section below for a list of ports used by
    EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes for finer control.

Network policies are beyond the scope of this document.
Please refer to the [Network policies](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
section of the Kubernetes documentation for further information.

#### Exposed ports

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes exposes ports at operator, instance manager, and operand
levels, as shown in the table.

| System           | Port number | Exposing            | Name             | Certificates | Authentication |
| :--------------- | :---------- | :------------------ | :--------------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| operator         | 9443        | webhook server      | `webhook-server` | TLS          | Yes            |
| operator         | 8080        | metrics             | `metrics`        | no TLS       | No             |
| instance manager | 9187        | metrics             | `metrics`        | no TLS       | No             |
| instance manager | 8000        | status              | `status`         | no TLS       | No             |
| operand          | 5432        | PostgreSQL instance | `postgresql`     | optional TLS | Yes            |

### PGD

The current implementation of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes creates
passwords for the postgres superuser and the database owner.

As far as encryption of passwords is concerned, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes follows
the default behavior of PostgreSQL: starting with PostgreSQL 14,
`password_encryption` is by default set to `scram-sha-256`. On earlier
versions, it's set to `md5`.

!!! Important
    See [Connection DSNs and SSL](/pgd/latest/nodes/#connection-dsns-and-ssl-tls)
    in the PGD documentation for details.

You can disable management of the postgres user password using secrets by setting
`enableSuperuserAccess` to `false` in the `cnp` section of the spec.

!!! Note
    The operator supports toggling the `enableSuperuserAccess` option. When you
    disable it on a running cluster, the operator ignores the content of the secret.
    Remove it (if previously generated by the operator) and set the password of the
    postgres user to `NULL`, in effect disabling remote access through password authentication.

### Storage

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes delegates encryption at rest to the underlying storage class. For
data protection in production environments, we highly recommend that you choose
a storage class that supports encryption at rest.
