You can test an EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster on your
laptop or computer using EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
on a single local
Kubernetes cluster built with [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).

!!! Warning
    These instructions are only for demonstration,
    testing, and practice purposes and must not be used in production.

This quick start shows you how to start an EDB Postgres Distributed
cluster on your local Kubernetes installation so you can experiment with it.

!!! Important
    To connect to the Kubernetes cluster, make sure that you have `kubectl` installed on your machine. 
    See the Kubernetes documentation
    on [installing `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/).

## Part 1 - Set up the local Kubernetes playground

Install Kind, a tool for running local Kubernetes
clusters using Docker container nodes. (Kind stands for Kubernetes IN Docker.)
If you already have access to a Kubernetes cluster, you can skip to Part 2.

Install Kind on your environment following the instructions in [Kind Quick Start](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start).
Then, create a Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kind create cluster --name pgd
```

<!--
TODO: Shall we suggest creating different nodes?

## Part 2 - Install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes

After you have a Kubernetes installation up and running on your laptop, you
can install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

See [Installation](installation_upgrade.md) for details.

## Part 3 - Deploy a PGD cluster

As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PGD cluster you need to
apply a configuration file that defines your desired `PGDGroup` resources that
make up a PGD cluster.

Some sample files are included in the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes repository. The
[flexible_3regions.yaml](../samples/flexible_3regions.yaml) manifest
contains the definition of a PGD cluster with two data groups and a global
witness node spread across three regions. Each data group consists of two data nodes
and a local witness node.

!!! Note 
    For more details about the available options, see
    the [API reference](api_reference.md).

You can deploy the `flexible-3-regions` example by saving it first and running:

```sh
kubectl apply -f flexible_3regions.yaml
```

You can check that the pods are being created using the `get pods` command:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

The pods are being created as part of PGD nodes. As described in the
[Architecture](architecture.md), they're implemented on top
of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes clusters.

You can list the clusters then, which shows the PGD nodes:

```sh
$ kubectl get clusters 
NAME         AGE     INSTANCES   READY   STATUS                     PRIMARY
region-a-1   2m50s   1           1       Cluster in healthy state   region-a-1-1
region-a-2   118s    1           1       Cluster in healthy state   region-a-2-1
region-a-3   91s     1           1       Cluster in healthy state   region-a-3-1
…
…
```

Ultimately, the PGD nodes are created as part of the PGD groups
that make up your PGD cluster.

```sh
$ kubectl get pgdgroups
NAME       DATA INSTANCES   WITNESS INSTANCES   PHASE                AGE
region-a   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy   4m50s
region-b   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy   4m50s
region-c   0                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy   4m50s
```

Notice how the region-c group is only a witness node.
