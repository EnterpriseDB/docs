EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes supports *online/hot backup* of
PGD clusters through physical backup and WAL archiving on an object store.
This means that the database is always up (no downtime required) and that
point-in-time recovery (PITR) is available.

## Common object stores

Multiple object stores are supported, such as AWS S3, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage,
Google Cloud Storage, MinIO Gateway, or any S3-compatible provider.
Given that EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes configures the connection with object stores by relying on
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, see the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes cloud provider support](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#cloud-provider-support)
documentation for more information.

!!! Important
    The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation's Cloud Provider configuration section is
    available at `spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`. In EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes examples, the object store section is at a 
    different path: `spec.backup.configuration.barmanObjectStore`.

## WAL archive

WAL archiving is the process that sends WAL files to the object storage, and it's essential to
execute online/hot backups or PITR.
In EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, each PGD node is set up to archive WAL files in the object store independently.

The WAL archive is defined in the PGD group `spec.backup.configuration.barmanObjectStore` stanza
and is enabled as soon as a destination path and cloud credentials are set.
You can choose to compress WAL files before uploading them and also or alternatively encrypt them.
In adddition, you can enable parallel WAL archiving.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
[...]
spec:
  backup:
    configuration:
      barmanObjectStore:
        [...]
        wal:
          compression: gzip
          encryption: AES256
          maxParallel: 8
```

For more information, see the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes WAL archiving](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#wal-archiving) documentation.

## Scheduled backups

Scheduled backups are the recommended way to configure your backup strategy in EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.
When the PGD group `spec.backup.configuration.barmanObjectStore` stanza is configured, the operator selects one of the
PGD data nodes as the elected backup node for which it creates a `Scheduled Backup` resource.

The `.spec.backup.cron.schedule` field allows you to define a cron schedule specification, expressed
in the [Go `cron` package format](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format).

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
[...]
spec:
  backup:
    cron:
      schedule: "0 0 0 * * *"
      backupOwnerReference: self
      suspend: false
      immediate: true
```

You can suspend scheduled backups by setting `.spec.backup.cron.suspend` to `true`. This setting
prevents any new backup from being scheduled.

If you want to execute a backup as soon as the `ScheduledBackup` resource is created,
you can set `.spec.backup.cron.immediate` to `true`.

`.spec.backupOwnerReference` indicates the `ownerReference` to use
in the created backup resources. The choices are:

-   `none` &mdash; No owner reference for created backup objects.
-   `self` &mdash; Sets the scheduled backup object as owner of the backup.
-   `cluster` &mdash; Sets the cluster as owner of the backup.

!!! Note
    The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes `ScheduledBackup` object contains the `cluster` option to specify the
    cluster to back up. This option is currently not supported by EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes and is
    ignored if specified.

If an elected backup node is deleted, the operator transparently elects a new backup node
and reconciles the `Scheduled Backup` resource accordingly.

## Retention policies

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes can manage the automated deletion of backup files from the backup
object store using retention policies based on the recovery window.
This process also takes care of removing unused WAL files and WALs associated with backups
that are scheduled for deletion.

You can define your backups with a retention policy of 30 days:

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
[...]
spec:
  backup:
    configuration:
      retentionPolicy: "30d"
```

For more information, see the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes retention policies](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#retention-policies) in the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation.

!!! Important
    Currently, the retention policy is applied only for the elected backup node
    backups and WAL files. Given that every other PGD node also archives its own WALs
    independently, it's your responsibility to manage the lifecycle of those WAL files,
    for example by leveraging the object storage data-retention policy.
    Also, in case you have an object storage data retention policy set up on every PGD node
    directory, make sure it's not overlapping or interfering with the retention policy managed
    by the operator.

## Compression algorithms

Backups and WAL files are uncompressed by default. However, multiple compression algorithms are
supported. For more information, see the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes compression algorithms](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#compression-algorithms) documentation.

## Tagging of backup objects

It's possible to specify tags as key-value pairs for the backup objects, namely base backups, WAL files, and history files.
For more information, see the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation about [tagging of backup objects](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#tagging-of-backup-objects).

## On-demand backups of a PGD node

A PGD node is represented as single-instance EDB Postgres for Kubernetes `Cluster` object.
As such, in case of need, it's possible to request an on-demand backup
of a specific PGD node by creating a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes `Backup` resource.
To do that, see [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes on-demand backups](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/backup_recovery/#on-demand-backups) in the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation.

!!! Hint
    You can retrieve the list of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes clusters that make up your PGD group
    by running: `kubectl get cluster -l k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/group=my-pgd-group -n my-namespace`
