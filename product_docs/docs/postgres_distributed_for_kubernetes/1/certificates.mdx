EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes was designed to natively support TLS certificates.
To set up an PGD cluster, each PGD node requires:

-   A server certification authority (CA) certificate
-   A server TLS certificate signed by the server CA
-   A client CA certificate
-   A streaming replication client certificate generated by the client CA

!!! Note
    You can find all the secrets used by each PGD node and the expiry dates in
    the cluster (PGD node) status.

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is very flexible when it comes to TLS certificates. It operates 
primarily in two modes:

1.  **Operator managed** &mdash; Certificates are internally
    managed by the operator in a fully automated way and signed using a CA created
    by EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.
2.  **User provided** &mdash; Certificates are
    generated outside the operator and imported in the cluster definition as
    secrets. EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes integrates itself with cert-manager.
