## EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes Operator configuration

The operator for EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) is installed from a standard
deployment manifest and follows the convention over configuration paradigm. While this is fine
in most cases, there are some scenarios where you want to change the default behavior, such as:

-   defining a different default image for PGD or PGD proxy
-   defining an additional pull secret for operator and operand images

The behavior of the operator can be customized through a `ConfigMap`/`Secret` that
is located in the same namespace of the operator deployment and with
`pgd-operator-controller-manager-config` as the name.

!!! Important
    Any change to the config's `ConfigMap`/`Secret` will not be automatically
    detected by the operator, - and as such, it needs to be reloaded (see below).
    Moreover, changes only apply to the resources created after the configuration
    is reloaded.

!!! Important
    The operator first processes the ConfigMap values and then the Secretâ€™s, in this order.
    As a result, if a parameter is defined in both places, the one in the Secret will be used.

### Available options

The operator looks for the following environment variables to be defined in the `ConfigMap`/`Secret`:

| Name                   | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `PGD_IMAGE_NAME`       | PGD operand image name to overwrite the default one in manifest.                                              |
| `PGD_PROXY_IMAGE_NAME` | PGD proxy operand image name to overwrite the default one in manifest.                                        |
| `PULL_SECRET_NAME`     | Name of an additional pull secret to be defined in the operator's namespace and to be used to download images |

When you specify an additional pull secret name using the `PULL_SECRET_NAME` parameter,
the operator will use that secret to create a pull secret for every created PGD group.
That secret will be named `<group-name>-pull`.

The namespace where the operator looks for the `PULL_SECRET_NAME` secret is where
you installed the operator. If the operator is not able to find that secret, it
will ignore the configuration parameter.

### Defining an operator config map

The example below customizes the behavior of the operator, by defining
an additional image pull secret.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: pgd-operator-controller-manager-config
  namespace: pgd-operator-system
data:
  PULL_SECRET_NAME: additional-pull-secret
```

### Defining an operator secret

The example below customizes the behavior of the operator, by defining
the default operand image names.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: pgd-operator-controller-manager-config
  namespace: pgd-operator-system
type: Opaque
stringData:
  PGD_IMAGE_NAME: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/postgresql-pgd:17.2-5.6.1-1
  PGD_PROXY_IMAGE_NAME: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.6.0-1
```

### Restarting the operator to reload configs

For the change to be effective, you need to recreate the operator pods to
reload the config map. If you have installed the operator on Kubernetes
using the manifest you can do that by issuing:

```shell
kubectl rollout restart deployment \
    -n pgd-operator-system \
    pgd-operator-controller-manager
```

Otherwise, If you have installed the operator using OLM, or you are running on
Openshift, run the following command specifying the namespace the operator is
installed in:

```shell
kubectl delete pods -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=pgd-operator
```

!!! Warning
    Customizations will be applied only to `PGD groups` resources created
    after the reload of the operator deployment.

### pprof HTTP Server

The operator can expose a PPROF HTTP server with the following endpoints on `localhost:6060`:

-   `/debug/pprof/`. Responds to a request for "/debug/pprof/" with an HTML page listing the available profiles
-   `/debug/pprof/cmdline`. Responds with the running program's command line, with arguments separated by NULL bytes.
-   `/debug/pprof/profile`. Responds with the pprof-formatted cpu profile. Profiling lasts for duration specified in seconds GET parameter, or for 30 seconds if not specified.
-   `/debug/pprof/symbol`. Looks up the program counters listed in the request, responding with a table mapping program counters to function names.
-   `/debug/pprof/trace`. Responds with the execution trace in binary form.  Tracing lasts for duration specified in seconds GET parameter, or for 1 second if not specified.

To enable the operator you need to edit the operator deployment add the flag `--pprof-server=true`.

You can do this by executing these commands:

```shell
kubectl edit deployment -n pgd-operator-system pgd-operator-controller-manager
```

Then on the edit page scroll down the container args and add
`--pprof-server=true`, as in this example:

```yaml
      containers:
      - args:
        - controller
        - --enable-leader-election
        - --config-map-name=pgd-operator-controller-manager-config
        - --secret-name=pgd-operator-controller-manager-config
        - --log-level=info
        - --pprof-server=true # relevant line
        command:
        - /manager
```

Save the changes; the deployment now will execute a roll-out, and the new pod
will have the PPROF server enabled.

## EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator configuration

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) operator manages each PGD node using the `Cluster`
resource defined by the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K) operator. Therefore,  the configuration for the PG4K
operator remains applicable. Please refer to the [operator configuration](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/operator_conf/)
for more details.
