*This page lists the status for currently supported
releases of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes*.

## Naming Scheme

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) releases follows Semantic Versioning
2.0.0 and is structured as follows:

```
<major>.<minor>.<patch>
```

-   `<major>` maps to the supported PGD version. Version 1.x corresponds to PGD version 5.x.
-   `<minor>` is incremented for each supported PG4K Long-Term Support release dependency change.
-   `<patch>` indexes the patches for the current `<minor>` release,
    representing small changes relative to the `<minor>` release.

Git tags for versions are prefixed with `v`.

## General Support status

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes version 1.x is used to manage Postgres Distributed version 5.x.
The general support status is as follows:

| Version | Currently Supported | Release Date | Supported Kubernetes Versions | Supported PG4K Versions | Supported Postgres versions | Supported Postgres Distributed versions |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1.x     | Yes                 | Apr 24, 2024 | v1.28 - v1.32                 | v1.22, v1.25            | v13 - v17                   | v5.5.1 - v5.6.1                         |

## Detailed support status

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) operator uses the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
(PG4K) operator to manage each PGD node as a PG4K Cluster. Each minor release reaches its End of Life
in alignment with the corresponding PG4K LTS release. For details on the support scope of each PG4K LTS
release, please refer to the [platform compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pgk8s)

!!! Note
    EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) version 1.0.0 did not restrict supported PG4K version
    to LTS releases. when upgrading PGD4K from 1.0.0 to 1.0.1, if the installed PG4K version exceeds 1.22,
    we must first uninstall the PG4K operator and reinstall it with a 1.22.x to satisfy the dependency
    requirements.
