## Deletion and finalizers

When deleting a PGD Group, the operator will start parting every node in the group first.
It will connect to an active instance and part every node in the target group.
Once a node is parted, it will not participate in replication and consensus operations.
To make sure the node is correctly parted before being deleted, the operator uses the
`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/partNodes` finalizer. Please refer to the
[kubernetes document on finalizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) 
for context.

!!! Note
    If a namespace holding a PGD Group is deleted directly, we can't ensure
    the deleting and parting sequence is carried out correctly. Before deleting
    a namespace, it is recommended to delete all the contained PGD groups.

## Time limit

When parting a node, the operator needs to connect to an active instance to
execute the `bdr.part_node` function. To avoid this operation hanging,
a time limit for the finalizer is used; by default, it is 300 seconds.
After the time limit expires, the finalizer will be removed, and the node
will be deleted anyway, potentially leaving stale metadata in the global PGD catalog.
This time limit can be configured through `spec.failingFinalizerTimeLimitSeconds`,
which is specified in seconds.

## Skip finalizer

For testing purposes only, the operator also provides an annotation to skip the
finalizer: `k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/noFinalizers`.
When this annotation is added to a PGDGroup, the finalizer will be skipped when
the PGDGroup is being deleted, and the nodes will not be parted from the PGD cluster.

## PGDGroup cleanup

### Cleanup parted node

Once the PGDGroup is deleted, its metadata will remain in the catalog in `PARTED`
state in the `bdr.node_summary` table. The PG4k-PGD operator
defines a CRD named `PGDGroupCleanup` to help clean up the `PARTED` PGDGroup.

In the example below, the `PGDGroupCleanup` executes locally from `region-a`,
and will clean up all of region-b, with the pre-requisite that all the nodes must be
 in the `PARTED` state.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroupCleanup
metadata:
  name: region-b-cleanup
spec:
  executor: region-a
  target: region-b
```

Please note that if the target group (`region-b` in the example) contains nodes
not in a `PARTED` state, the Group Cleanup will stop in phase
`PGDGroupCleanup - Target PGDGroup is not parted, waiting for it to be parted before executing PGDGroupCleanup`.
In cases of extreme need, we can add the `force` option.

!!! Warning
    Using `force` can leave the PGD cluster in an inconsistent state. Use it only to
    recover from failures in which you can't part the group nodes any other way.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroupCleanup
metadata:
  name: region-b-cleanup
spec:
  force: true
  executor: region-a
  target: region-b
```
