The images for the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes and EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes operators, as well as various operands, are kept in private
container image registries under `docker.enterprisedb.com`.

!!! Important
    Access to the private registries requires an account with EDB and is
    reserved for EDB customers with a valid [subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#selfmanagedenterpriseplan).
    Credentials are run through your EDB account.
    For trials, see [Trials](#trials).

## Which repository to choose?

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is available as part of the Extreme
High Availability Add-On on top of either the EDB Enterprise Plan or EDB
Standard Plan.

Depending on your subscription plan, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
is in one of the following repositories.

| Plan                  | Repository           |
| --------------------- | -------------------- |
| EDB Standard Plan     | `k8s_standard_pgd`   |
| EDB EnterpriseDB Plan | `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |

Use the name of the repository as the username when you
log in to the EDB container registry, for example, through `docker login` or a
[`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types).

!!! Important
    Each repository contains all the images you can access with your plan.
    You don't need to connect to different repositories to access different
    images, such as operator or operand images.

## How to retrieve the token

In the [repos page in EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads),
is an EDB Repos 2.0 section where a repo token appears obscured.

![EDB Repo Portal](images/edb-repo-portal.png)

Next to the repo token is a **Copy Token** button to copy the token and an eye icon
for looking at the content of the token.

Use the repo token as the password when you log in to the EDB
container registry.

### Example with `docker login`

You can log in using Docker from your terminal. We suggest that you
copy the repo token using **Copy Token**. The `docker` command prompts you for a username and a password.

The username is the repo you're trying to access,
and the password is the token you just copied:

```sh
$ docker login docker.enterprisedb.com  
Username: k8s_enterprise_pgd
Password: 
Login Succeeded
```

## Trials

If you're a trialist or a preview user, use `k8s_enterprise_pgd` as the name
of the repository, and follow the instructions in
[How to retrieve the token](#how-to-retrieve-the-token) for the token.

## Operand images

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is an operator that supports running
EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) version 5 on three PostgreSQL distributions:

-   PostgreSQL
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server
-   EDB Postgres Extended

!!! Important
    See [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/choosing_server/)
    in the PGD documentation for details and a comparison of PGD on the
    different supported PostgreSQL distributions.

Due to the immutable application container adoption in EDB operators, the
operator expects for the container images to include all the binaries required
to run the requested version of PGD on top of the required distribution and
version of Postgres.

These images follow the requirements and the conventions described in 
[Container image requirements](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/)
in the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation, adding the `bdr5`
extension.

The table shows the image name prefix for each Postgres distribution.

| Postgres distribution | Versions | Image name                  | Repositories                             |
| --------------------- | -------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Extended | 15, 14   | `edb-postgres-extended-pgd` | `k8s_standard_pgd`, `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |
| EDB Postgres Advanced | 15, 14   | `edb-postgres-advanced-pgd` | `k8s_enterprise_pgd`                     |
