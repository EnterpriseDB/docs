When scaling up a PGD group by adding more data nodes or creating cross-region groups,
it's crucial for new nodes to join the existing group properly. There are two methods for
joining:

-   Logical join

      This method uses the [bdr.join_node_group](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function to integrate the new node into the PGD group.
      It's important that the joining node doesn't contain any schemas or data present in the PGD group.
      We recommend that the new database contain only the BDR extension, as data synchronization occurs during
      the join.

-   Physical join

      This method uses the [bdr_init_physical](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes/#bdr_init_physical) command to speed up the joining process. You can prepare data in advance before executing `bdr_init_physical`.

For more information about join methods, see [Creating and joining PGD groups](/pgd/latest/node_management/creating_and_joining/#creating-and-joining-pgd-groups).

## The initial group

The PGD4K operator allows you to configure the join methods for nodes joining PGD groups
as well as for groups joining other groups.

When creating a single PGD group, you must configure it to create the *parent
group* (`spec.pgd.parentGroup.create`=true). If you intend to create multiple PGD groups that
will cross join, at least one of these groups must be designated to form the parent group.
This group is referred to as the *initial* PGD group.

The first node in the `initial` PGD group can either be restored from a backup
(as described in the recovery documentation) or created from scratch. This node will always
use a logical join to connect to the parent group it created. Conversely, the first node in
the *non-initial* PGD group is used for cross joining with other PGD groups.

You can configure the join method for the first
node (group join) and the subsequent nodes (node join) separately.

!!! Note
    In the scenario where a group joins another group, the first node of the joining group
    actually creates the group first before joining a different group (either physically or logically).

## Configure the join method for node join

You can configure the join method for a node joining a group when
scaling up the PGD group and adding new nodes to the local group. In this context, the joining group is
the same as the node group.

![node join local group](images/local_join.png)

The `spec.cnp.joinMethod` parameter configures how a node joins a local group. By default,
a logical join is used. To enable a physical join for a new node, set `spec.cnp.joinMethod`=`physical`.

In the following example, the second node uses the `pg_basebackup` command to replicate data from the
first node in the `region-a` group. Then it uses `bdr_init_physical` to join the `region-a` group.

This example shows a physical join:

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: region-a
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  cnp:
    joinMethod: physical
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
  ...
```

## Configure the join method for group join

You can configure the join method for group joins when creating
cross-region PGD groups. The first node in the new PGD group joins an existing PGD group.
In this context, the joining group is distinct from the node group.

![node join remote group](images/remote_join.png)

The PGD4K operator uses the `spec.pgd.joinMethod` section (which defaults to logical) to determine
how PGD groups join with each other. It uses the `spec.pgd.discovery` section to specify the target to join.

This example shows a logical join, where `spec.pgd.groupJoinMethod=logical`. The first node
in the region-b group waits for all hosts specified in `spec.pgd.discovery` to become available. It then
identifies a suitable target to perform the logical join using the `bdr.join_node_group` function. The
*group service* of all remote groups is typically defined in the discovery section for this type of join.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: region-b
  namespace: region-b
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  pgd:
    parentGroup:
      name: world
    groupJoinMethod: logical
    discovery:
      - host: region-a-group
      - host: region-c-group
  cnp:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```

This example shows a physical join, configured with `spec.pgd.groupJoinMethod=physical`.
The first node in the region-b group will traverse all the nodes defined in `spec.pgd.discovery`,
waiting to find one node with a successful Raft consensus to perform the physical join using `bdr_init_physical`.
Typically, the *node service* of the remote group is specified in the discovery section for this type of join.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: region-b
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  pgd:
    parentGroup:
      name: world
    groupJoinMethod: physical
    discovery:
      - host: region-a-3-node
      - host: region-a-1-node
      - host: region-a-2-node
  cnp:
    joinMethod: physical
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```

!!! Note
    A group join is essentially a type of node join, specifically when the first node in the group
    joins a node from a different group.

!!! Note
    Witness nodes always use a logical join to connect to a group.
