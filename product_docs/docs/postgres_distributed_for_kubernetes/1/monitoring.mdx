## Monitoring Instances

By default, the PG4K operator provides an HTTP/HTTPS metrics exporter for [Prometheus]((https://prometheus.io/))
and also comes with a [predefined set of metrics](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/monitoring/#predefined-set-of-metrics) as well as a highly configurable and customizable
[user defined metrics](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/monitoring/#user-defined-metrics).
The PGD operator offers a central location for monitoring settings in the `spec.cnp.monitoring` section, which will be applied to all nodes in the PGD group. For more details on configuring monitoring, please refer to the [monitoring section]((https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/monitoring/)).

## Monitoring Operator

Like PG4K operator, the PGD operator also internally exposes Prometheus metrics via HTTP
on port 8080, named `metrics`.

Currently, the PGD operator exposes default kubebuilder metrics. See [kubebuilder documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/reference/metrics.html) for more details.

## Monitor on Openshift

Please refer to [Monitoring on OpenShift](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/monitoring/#monitoring-on-openshift) section for details.
