A PGD group has its own `ImageCatalog` and `ClusterImageCatalog`. `ImageCatalog` and `ClusterImageCatalog`
are essential resources that allow you to define PGD and PGD Proxy images for creating a `PGDGroup`.

The key distinction is in their scope: an `ImageCatalog` is namespaced, while
a `ClusterImageCatalog` is cluster scoped.

Both share a common structure, comprising a list of PGD images and a Proxy image.
Each PGD image contains a `major` field indicating the major Postgres version of the image.

!!! Warning
    The operator trusts the user-defined major version and doesn't conduct
    any PostgreSQL version detection. It's your responsibility to ensure
    alignment between the declared major version in the catalog and the PostgreSQL image.

The `major` field's value must remain unique in a catalog, preventing duplication across images.
However, distinct catalogs can expose different images under the same `major` value.

## Example of a namespaced `ImageCatalog`

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: ImageCatalog
metadata:
  name: pgd-postgres-extended
  namespace: default
spec:
  images:
    - major: 15
      image: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:15.12-5.7.0-1
    - major: 16
      image:  docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:16.8-5.7.0-1
  proxyImage: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.0-1
```

## Example of a cluster-wide catalog using `ClusterImageCatalog` resource

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImageCatalog
metadata:
  name: pgd-postgres-extended
spec:
  images:
    - major: 15
      image: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:15.12-5.7.0-1
    - major: 16
      image:  docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:16.8-5.7.0-1
  proxyImage: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.0-1

```

A `PGDGroup` resource has the flexibility to reference either an `ImageCatalog`
or a `ClusterImageCatalog` to precisely specify the desired image:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example
spec:
  [...]
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io
    kind: ImageCatalog
    name: pgd-postgres-extended
    major: 16
  [...]
```

PGD groups utilizing these catalogs maintain continuous monitoring.
Any alterations to the images in a catalog trigger automatic updates for
all associated PGD groups that reference that specific entry.
