PGDGroup has its own `ImageCatalog` and `ClusterImageCatalog`. `ImageCatalog` and `ClusterImageCatalog`
are essential resources that allow you to define pgd and proxy images for creating a `PGDGroup`.

The key distinction lies in their scope: an `ImageCatalog` is namespaced, while
a `ClusterImageCatalog` is cluster-scoped.

Both share a common structure, comprising a list of PGD images and a Proxy image.
Each PGD image contains a `major` field indicating the major Postgres version of the image.

!!! Warning
    The operator trusts the user-defined major version and does not conduct
    any PostgreSQL version detection. It is the user's responsibility to ensure
    alignment between the declared major version in the catalog and the PostgreSQL image.

The `major` field's value must remain unique within a catalog, preventing duplication across images.
However, distinct catalogs may expose different images under the same `major` value.

**Example of a Namespaced `ImageCatalog`:**

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: ImageCatalog
metadata:
  name: pgd-postgres-extended
  namespace: default
spec:
  images:
    - major: 15
      image: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:15.12-5.7.0-1
    - major: 16
      image:  docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:16.8-5.7.0-1
  proxyImage: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.0-1
```

**Example of a Cluster-Wide Catalog using `ClusterImageCatalog` Resource:**

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterImageCatalog
metadata:
  name: pgd-postgres-extended
spec:
  images:
    - major: 15
      image: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:15.12-5.7.0-1
    - major: 16
      image:  docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended:16.8-5.7.0-1
  proxyImage: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.0-1

```

A `PGDGroup` resource has the flexibility to reference either an `ImageCatalog`
or a `ClusterImageCatalog` to precisely specify the desired image.

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example
spec:
  [...]
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io
    kind: ImageCatalog
    name: pgd-postgres-extended
    major: 16
  [...]
```

PGDGroups utilizing these catalogs maintain continuous monitoring.
Any alterations to the images within a catalog trigger automatic updates for
**all associated PGDGroups** referencing that specific entry.

## EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes Catalogs

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes project maintains `ClusterImageCatalogs` for the images it
provides. These catalogs are regularly updated with the latest images for each
major version. By applying the `ClusterImageCatalog.yaml` file from the [link to file], cluster administrators can ensure
that their PGDGroups are automatically updated to the latest version within the
specified major release.
