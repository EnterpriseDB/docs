EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes was designed to work with applications
that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster for a full cloud native
experience.

However, it might happen that, while the database can be hosted
inside a Kubernetes cluster, applications can't be containerized
at the same time and need to run in a traditional environment such
as a VM.

The following is a summary of the basic considerations. See the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/use_cases/)
for more detail.

## Case 1: Applications inside Kubernetes

In a typical situation, the application and the database run in the same
namespace inside a Kubernetes cluster.

The application, normally stateless, is managed as a standard deployment,
with multiple replicas spread over different Kubernetes nodes and internally
exposed through a ClusterIP service.

The service is exposed externally to the end user through an Ingress and the
provider's load balancer facility by way of HTTPS.

## Case 2: Applications outside Kubernetes

Another possible use case is to manage your PGD database inside
Kubernetes while having your applications outside of it, for example, in a
virtualized environment. In this case, PGD is represented by an IP
address or host name and a TCP port, corresponding to the defined Ingress
resource in Kubernetes.

The application can still benefit from a TLS connection to PGD.
