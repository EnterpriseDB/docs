EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes has been designed to work with applications
that reside in the same Kubernetes cluster, for a full cloud native
experience.

However, it might happen that, while the database can be hosted
inside a Kubernetes cluster, applications cannot be containerized
at the same time and need to run in a *traditional environment* such
as a VM.

We reproduce here a summary of the basic considerations, and refer
you to the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/use_cases/)
for further depth.

## Case 1: Applications inside Kubernetes

In a typical situation, the application and the database run in the same
namespace inside a Kubernetes cluster.

The application, normally stateless, is managed as a standard `Deployment`,
with multiple replicas spread over different Kubernetes node, and internally
exposed through a `ClusterIP` service.

The service is exposed externally to the end user through an `Ingress` and the
provider's load balancer facility, via HTTPS.

## Case 2: Applications outside Kubernetes

Another possible use case is to manage your Postgres Distributed database inside
Kubernetes, while having your applications outside of it (for example in a
virtualized environment). In this case, Postgres Distributed is represented by an IP
address (or host name) and a TCP port, corresponding to the defined Ingress
resource in Kubernetes.

The application can still benefit from a TLS connection to Postgres Distributed.
