These predefined labels are managed by the EDB Postgres Distributed for
Kubernetes operator.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/certificateType`
: Indicates the type of the certificates. `replication` indicates a certificate
to be used to authenticate the replication client. `server` indicates a
certificate to be used for server authentication.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/group`
: Name of the PGDGroup that the resource belongs to. Added to cluster or
instance resources.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/isWitnessService`
: Indicates a service is for a witness node.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/type`
: Type of the resource added to cluster or instance resources, usually `node`.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/workloadType`
: Indicates the workload type of the resource added to cluster or instance
resources. `pgd-node-data` indicates data node; `pgd-node-witness` a witness
node; `pgd-proxy` for PGD Proxy node;
`proxy-svc` for PGD Proxy service; `group-svc` for PGD group service to
communicate with any node in the PGDGroup;
`node-svc` is a service created from the CNP service template;
`scheduled-backup` is added to `scheduledBackup`
resources; `bootstrap-cross-location-pgd-group` is added to the pod that
creates a cross-location PGD group;
`pgd-node-restore` is added to the pod that starts the node restore process.

## Predefined annotations

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/dirtyMetadata`
: Set in CNP cluster that have been generated from a backup and need to have
their metadata cleaned up
before creating the PGD node. This is written by the restore job.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/hash`
: To determine if any updates are required for the corresponding resources, holds the hash of the certain part of PGDGroup spec that's used in entities 
like `Cluster`, `ScheduledBackup`, `StatefulSet`, and `Service (node, group and proxy service)`.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/latestCleanupExecuted`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate that the cleanup was executed.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/node`
: Contains the name of the node for which a certain certificate was
generated. Added to the certificate resources.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/nodeRestartHash`
: Stores the hash of the CNP configuration in PGDGroup. A restart is needed when the configuration
is changed.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/noFinalizers`
: Set in the PGDGroup with value `true` to skip the finalizer execution.
For internal use only.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/pause`
: Set in the PGDGroup to pause a PGDGroup.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/recoverabilityPointsByMethod`
: Set in the PGDGroup to store the CNP cluster's first recoverability points by
method in a tamper-proof place.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/seedingServer`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate to the operator which server to
restore. This is written by the restore job.

`k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/seedingSnapshots`
: Set in the PGDGroup to indicate to the operator which snapshots to
restore. This is written by the restore job.
