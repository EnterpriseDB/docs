## What is PGD Essential?

At the heart of PGD Essential is a bi-directional replication extension for PostgreSQL. By combining three Postgres database instances, using this extension, PGD Essential is able to provide high availability and disaster recovery for your databases.

## Why use PGD Essential?

PGD Essential offers a number of benefits over traditional replication solutions. Here are just a few of the reasons why you should consider using PGD Essential:

- **High availability**: PGD Essential provides automatic failover in the event of a primary database outage, ensuring that your applications remain online and accessible to users.
- **Disaster recovery**: PGD Essential allows you to easily create a secondary database, local to your primary database to handle database server maintenance and outages. You can then combine that with a third database instance in a different location, providing protection against data loss in the event of a disaster.
- **Real-time replication**: PGD Essential replicates data between databases in real-time, ensuring that your secondary databases are always up-to-date with the primary.
