## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install epel-release
  ```

- Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies
  ```shell
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-postgresextended<xx>-server edb-postgresextended<xx>-contrib
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Extended Server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be edb-postgresextended15-server edb-postgresextended15-contrib.
