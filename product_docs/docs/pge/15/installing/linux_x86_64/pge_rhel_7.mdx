## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  ```

- Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies
  ```shell
  subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo yum -y install edb-postgresextended<xx>-server edb-postgresextended<xx>-contrib
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Extended Server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be edb-postgresextended15-server edb-postgresextended15-contrib.
