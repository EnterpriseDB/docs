EDB Postgres Extended Server is a Postgres database server distribution built on open-source, community PostgreSQL. It is fully compatible with PostgreSQL. If you have applications written and tested to work with PostgreSQL, they will behave the same with EDB Postgres Extended Server. We will support and fix any functionality or behavior differences between community PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server. 

EDB Postgres Extended Server's primary purpose is to extend PostgreSQL with a limited number of features that cannot be implemented as extensions, such as [enhanced replication optimization](replication) used by [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest/) and [Transparent Data Encryption](/tde/latest/), while maintaining parity in other respects. 

Additional value-add enterprise features include:
- Security though [Transparent Data Encryption](/tde/latest/)

- Optional [SQL superset](sql_features) to community PostgreSQL
- [WAL pacing delays to avoid flooding transaction log](./operation/#avoid-flooding-transaction-logs)
- [Additional tracing and diagnostics options](./operation/#additional-tracing-and-diagnostics-options)
