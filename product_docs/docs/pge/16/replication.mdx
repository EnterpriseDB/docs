EDB Postgres Extended Server provides the core functionality to support the following replication and high availability features in [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest):

- Commit At Most Once (CAMO)	
- Group commit	
- Eager replication	
- Decoding worker	
- Assessment tooling	
- Lag tracker	
- Lag control	
- Timestamp snapshots	
- Transaction streaming	
- Missing partition conflict	
- No need for UPDATE trigger on tables with TOAST	
- Automatically hold back FREEZE

## Asynchronous processing

EDB Postgres Extended Server includes a `synchronous_replication_availability` parameter.
A value of `async` for this parameter enables asynchronous
processing when not enough standby
servers are available (when compared with the values as per
`synchronous_standby_names`). The behavior reverts
to synchronous replication when the required number of synchronous
standby servers reappear.
