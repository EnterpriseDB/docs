title: JDBC properties for setting rollback scope 
originalFilePath: jdbctxnrollback.md

---

If you're using a JDBC connector to connect to a client application, you use the `autosave` and `transaction_rollback_scope` properties together to specify the transaction rollback scope.

You can specify these properties in either the connection URL or as an
additional properties object parameter to `DriverManager.getConnection`.

## autosave

The `autosave` parameter is a string that specifies what the driver does if a query containing
multiple statements fails. The possible values are: `server`, `always`, `never`, and `conservative`. 

- In `autosave=server` mode, JDBC relies on the server-side parameter `transaction_rollback_scope`
to save each statement by way of internal server savepoints before
executing the next. The server rolls back to the previous
statement if any statement in the query fails. If this parameter
isn't supported on the server side, JDBC rejects the connection. 

- In `autosave=always` mode, the JDBC driver first tries to use the server-side `transaction_rollback_scope` property. If it isn't supported,
then JDBC driver sets a savepoint before each query
statement and rolls back to that savepoint in case of failure.
      
- In `autosave=never` mode (default), no savepoint activity is ever
carried out. In `autosave=conservative` mode, savepoint is set for
each query. However, the rollback is done only for rare cases like
'cached statement cannot change return type' or 'statement XXX is
not valid', so JDBC driver rolls back and retries.

The default value for this property is `never`.

This `autosave=server` property is useful only
with the PostgreSQL server providing `transaction_rollback_scope`
functionality.

## transaction_rollback_scope

The `autosave` parameter is a string that determines the range of
operations that roll back when an SQL statement fails. 

The default value is `TRANSACTION`, which causes the entire transaction or
current subtransaction to roll back. This is the only mode
that you can select with the `SET TRANSACTION` command. 
      
You can specify the other possible mode, `STATEMENT`, only during connection establishment, `ALTER USER`, or `ALTER DATABASE`. In that mode, only
the failed `SQL` statement is rolled back, and the transaction is put back in normal mode.

## `autosave` test cases
Test cases for trying out values of the `autosave` property
are available in the `BatchAutoSaveTest.java` file. The following
SQL code shows the behavior that's expected when the
server provides `transaction_rollback_scope` functionality and
`autosave=server` is used on the JDBC side.

With `autosave=server`, the following query inserts values `(1)`, `(3)`, and
`(4)` and disregards the `duplicate key violation` error:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test (id INT PRIMARY KEY);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (2);
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO test VALUES (1);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (2);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (3);
INSERT INTO test VALUES (4);
COMMIT;
```


The `artifacts` directory contains the `pgjdbc` jar file
`postgresql-REL2Q.42.2.3.180601.jar`. This file needs to
be added to the CLASSPATH as usual. It also contains the
`postgresql-REL2Q.42.2.3.180601-tests.jar` jar that can be used to test
the latest `autosave` functionality.

You can test the `BatchAutoSaveTest.java` file provided in the `artifacts` as follows:

1. Export CLASSPATH to build and run the test case:

   ```sh
   cd artifacts
   export CLASSPATH=$PWD:$PWD/postgresql-REL2Q.42.2.3.180601-tests.jar:$PWD/postgresql-REL2Q.42.2.3.180601.jar:$PWD/junit-4.12.jar:$PWD/hamcrest-core-1.3.jar
   ```

1. Compile the supplied test file:

   ```sh
   javac -d . BatchAutoSaveTest.java
   ```

1. Run the test (assuming user as `test` and running on localhost):

   ```shell
   java -Dusername=test -Dport=5432 -Dhost=localhost -Ddatabase=postgres org.junit.runner.JUnitCore org.postgresql.test.jdbc2.BatchAutoSaveTest
   __OUTPUT__

   ```

To modify the test cases, you can modify the `BatchAutoSaveTest.java` file
in the `artifacts` directory. Then compile and run the test cases.
