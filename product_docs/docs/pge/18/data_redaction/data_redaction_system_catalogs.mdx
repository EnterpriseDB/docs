System catalogs store the redaction policy information.

## pg_redaction_policy

The catalog `data_redaction.pg_redaction_policy` stores information about the redaction policies for tables.

| Column         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rppolicyid`   | The unique number to identify a data retention policy. The value in this field is added by a sequence.                                                                                         |
| `rpname`       | The name of the data redaction policy.                                                                                                                                                         |
| `rprelname`    | The relation on which redaction policy is created.                                                                                                                                             |
| `rprelschema`  | Schema name in which the relation resides.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `rpenable`     | Status of the redaction policy. The default value is `true`. If the value is `true` means the policy is enabled and active. If the value is `false` means the policy is disabled and inactive. |
| `rpexpr`       | The data redaction policy expression. If the expression is evaluated true then the policy is applied.                                                                                                    |
| `rpsearchpath` | The value of search path set while creating the redaction policy.                                                                                                                              |

!!! Note
    The data redaction policy applies for the relation if it's enabled and the expression ever evaluated true.

## pg_redaction_column

The `data_redactionp.pg_redaction_column` system catalog stores information about the data redaction policy attached to the columns of a table.

| Column        | Description                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `rcpolicyid`  | The unique number to identify a data redaction policy.              |
| `rcrelname`   | The relation on which redaction policy is created.                  |
| `rcrelschema` | Schema name in which the relation resides.                          |
| `rcattname`   | Relation's column name having the redaction policy.                 |
| `rcscope`     | The scope defined for the redaction policy.                         |
| `rcexception` | The exception defined for the redaction policy.                     |
| `rcfuncexpr`  | The redaction function name that defines on how to redact the data. |

!!! Note
    The described column is redacted if the redaction policy `data_redaction.pg_redaction_column.rcpolicyid` on the table is enabled and the redaction policy expression `data_redaction.pg_redaction_policy.rpexpr` evaluates to `true`.

## redaction_policy_status

The `redaction_policy_status` view shows the health of all current data redaction policies, reporting a status of either `Valid` or `Invalid`.

A `Valid` status means the policy is correctly configured and all required underlying objects (like functions or tables) are present.

An `Invalid` status indicates that the policy cannot be properly applied because one or more of its necessary objects are missing or no longer exist.
