The `password_profile` extension introduces a profile-based system for enforcing advanced password management rules on user accounts. It gives privileged users the ability to apply crucial security restrictions, such as:

- Controlling detailed password policies (e.g., minimum length, complexity).

- Automatically locking accounts after repeated failed logins.

Essentially, this tool provides administrators with greater control and security over user passwords than standard PostgreSQL offers, which is vital for meeting modern compliance requirements.
