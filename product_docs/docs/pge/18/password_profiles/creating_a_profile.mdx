The `password_profile` extension automatically creates a system-generated `DEFAULT` profile that sets the default limits for all the parameters. You can change the parameter values for the `DEFAULT` profile, however it can't be dropped or renamed. You can create new profiles and set any parameter to -1 to inherit the corresponding value from the `DEFAULT` profile.

The `PG_CREATE_PROFILE` api defines a new profile for password management.

## Synopsis

```sql
PASSWORD_PROFILE.PG_CREATE_PROFILE('profilename', 
                                   failed_login_attempts, 
                                   password_lock_time, 
                                   password_life_time, 
                                   password_grace_time, 
                                   password_verify_function)
```

## Description

The `PG_CREATE_PROFILE` api creates a new profile for password management. The profile defines the profile name, limits for failed login attempts, account lock time, password expriation and grace period, and the password verification function for complexity checks.

## Parameters

- `profilename` &mdash; Name of the password profile to create.

- `failed_login_attempts` &mdash; Number of consecutive failed login attempts allowed before the account is locked. A value of 0 means no limit.

- `password_lock_time` &mdash; Duration (in days) for which the account remains locked after exceeding the allowed failed login attempts. A value of 0 means the account remains locked until manually unlocked by an administrator.

- `password_life_time` &mdash; Duration (in days) after which the password expires and must be changed. A value of 0 means the password never expires.

- `password_grace_time` &mdash; Duration (in days) after password expiration during which the user can still log in and change the password. A value of 0 means no grace period.

- `password_verify_function` &mdash; Name of the password verification function that checks the complexity of the new password. This function should return true if the password meets the complexity requirements, and false otherwise.
