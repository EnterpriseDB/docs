## 2ndQuadrant Postgres 13.18

Release date: 2024-11-21

This release is primarily an upstream merge. 

Merged with community PostgreSQL 13.18. See the [PostgreSQL 13.18 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13-18.html) for more information.

## 2ndQuadrant Postgres 13.16.1r1.1.19

Release date: 2024-08-22

This release is primarily a bug fix release. It contains a variety of improvements over the previous release.

### Migration

A dump/restore using [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-pg-dumpall.html) is required if you want to migrate data from any previous community PostgreSQL release.

### Changes

- A previous release introduced a new `in_create` field to the LogicalDecodingContext structure and changed its memory layout. This means that any code that expects the old layout will no longer be compatible. The release fixed the issue to ensure that the layout of previous database server versions is still compatible with the creation of a logical replication slot.

## 2ndQuadrant Postgres 13.0r1.1.1

Release date: 2020-11-05

This is the first release in the r1.1.x series of releases. This release contains a variety of improvements over PostgreSQL 13.0. For more information about new features in the core 13.0 release, see the [Postgres 13 release notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release.html).



### Migration

A dump/restore using [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/app-pg-dumpall.html) is required if you want to migrate data from any previous community PostgreSQL release.



### Changes


- Rebased to the REL_13_0 tag of the community PostgreSQL code base.

- Show a backtrace for PANIC messages by default even if guc is disabled.

     Getting to know the stack trace for PANIC messages is handy for
     forensics. So show the backtrace for such messages regardless of whether the
     `pg2q.backtrace_on_internal_error` configuration parameter is enabled.
    
- Provided a way to skip checking of NOT VALID constraints.

    While NOT VALID constraints are normally checked and enforced for new rows
    being inserted/updated into the database, we provide an optional facility to
    skip the checks. This is useful for apply workers that may choose to skip the
    check, either because the check is done on the origin or because the
    check is known to potentially produce an ERROR and you instead want to rely
    on subsequent VALIDATE CONSTRAINT to catch violations.
    
- Added a table-level option to control compression.

    We now support a new table level-option, `compress_tuple_target`, which can be
    set to decide when to trigger compression on a tuple. Prior to this, the
    `toast_tuple_target` (or the compile time default) was used to decide whether
    to compress a tuple. But this was detrimental when a tuple is large enough
    and has a good compression ratio but not large enough to cross the toast
    threshold. We didn't compress such tuples, thus wasting a potentially good
    opportunity.
    
- COPY FREEZE: Check if all tuples in a given page of a given table are frozen and visible, without doing any extensive checks.

    We typically do this when we're doing table insertions in
    TABLE_INSERT_FROZEN mode (for example, COPY FREEZE). Since the relation isn't
    visible to any other transactions when running in this mode, we usually
    expect the pages to contain only tuples with frozen-xmin and invalid-xmax.
    But to guard against the case when our own transaction may have
    inserted regular tuples, which aren't marked frozen, in the table and for
    abundance of caution, we also do this check.
    
- Added 2ndQPostgres configuration parameters to limit max tuple size and max field size.

    The new `pg2q.max_tuple_size` parameter restricts the maximum before-TOASTing size that
    can be written to a table. This value is the total row width including the
    uncompressed width of all TOASTable VARLENA attributes.

    TABLE_INSERT_FROZEN mode (for example, COPY FREEZE). Since the relation isn't
    visible to any other transactions when running in this mode, we usually
    expect the pages to contain only tuples with frozen-xmin and invalid-xmax.
    But to guard against the case when our own transaction may have
    inserted regular tuples, which aren't marked frozen, in the table and for
    abundance of caution, we do this check also.
    
- Added 2ndQPostgres configuration parameters to limit max tuple size and max field size.

    The new `pg2q.max_tuple_size` parameter restricts the maximum before-TOASTing size that
    can be written to a table. This is the total row width including the
    uncompressed width of all TOASTable VARLENA attributes.
