If you used `apt-get` to install a Debian package of EDB Postgres Extended Server (on Ubuntu, Debian), use `apt-get` to perform a minor version upgrade of the packages.

## Overview 

1.  Upgrade the EDB Postgres Extended Server packages with `apt-get install`. 

1.  Restart the server with `pg_ctl`. 

1.  Verify the server version with psql. 

## Worked example

1.  To upgrade the existing packages, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter the command:

    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install <package_name>
    ```

    For example, if you want to upgrade to the latest minor version of EDB Postgres Extended Server 17, run:
    
    ```shell
    sudo apt-get install edb-postgresextended-17
    ```

    !!!Note
       You can perform a search of the packages to ensure you update the right package beforehand. For example, to browse through all EDB Packages, you can run `sudo apt-cache edb`. For more information about using `apt-get` commands and options, enter `apt-get --help` at the command line.

1.  Confirm with `Y`.

    The output displays an overview of all performed processes, where you can see the packages that were upgraded.

1.  To finalize the upgrade, restart the server. Replace `<path_to_data_directory>` with the path to the data directory of the server or servers you're upgrading:

    ```shell
    /usr/lib/edb-pge/17/bin/pg_ctl -D <path_to_data_directory> restart
    ```

    For example: 

    ```shell
    /usr/lib/edb-pge/17/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/edb-pge/17/upgrade restart
    ```

1.  Verify the expected database version is running by connecting to psql: 

    ```shell
    /usr/lib/edb-pge/17/bin/psql
    ```
    
    Check the server version: 

    ```psql
    SHOW server_version;
    __OUTPUT__
                               server_version
    --------------------------------------------------------------------

    ```
