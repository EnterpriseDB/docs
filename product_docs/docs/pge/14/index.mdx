EDB Postgres Extended Server is a Postgres database server distribution built on open-source, community PostgreSQL. It's fully compatible with PostgreSQL. If you have applications written and tested to work with PostgreSQL, they will behave the same with EDB Postgres Extended Server. We will support and fix any functionality or behavior differences between community PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server.

EDB Postgres Extended Server's primary purpose is to extend PostgreSQL with a limited number of features that can't be implemented as extensions, such as enhanced replication optimization used by EDB Postgres Distributed database and other features that aren't yet available in the community PostgreSQL.
