## EDB Postgres Extended Server 14.15

Release date: 2024-11-21

This release is primarily an upstream merge. 

Merged with community PostgreSQL 14.15. See the [PostgreSQL 14.15 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14-15.html) for more information.

## EDB Postgres Extended Server 14.13.1

Release date: 2024-08-22

This release is primarily a bug fix release. It contains a variety of improvements over the previous release.

### Migration

A dump/restore using [pg_dumpall](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/app-pg-dumpall.html) is required if you want to migrate data from any previous community PostgreSQL release.

### Changes

- A previous release introduced a new `in_create` field to the LogicalDecodingContext structure and changed its memory layout. This means that any code that expects the old layout will no longer be compatible. The release fixed the issue to ensure that the layout of previous database server versions is still compatible with the creation of a logical replication slot.
