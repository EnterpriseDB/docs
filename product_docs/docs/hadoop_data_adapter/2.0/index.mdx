title: "Hadoop Data Adapters Guide"
---



The EDB Postgres Hadoop data adapter (`hdfs_fdw`) is a Postgres extension that allows you to access data that resides on a Hadoop file system from an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL server. The data adapter makes the Hadoop file system a read-only data source that you can use with Postgres functions and utilities, or in conjunction with other data that resides on a Postgres host.

The Postgres data adapter can be installed with a graphical installer or an RPM package. You can download an installer from the EnterpriseDB website; visit:

This guide uses the term `Postgres` to refer to an instance of either EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.

**Limitations**

Please note: The `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` data types are supported only on systems using Apache Hive version 2.3.1.
