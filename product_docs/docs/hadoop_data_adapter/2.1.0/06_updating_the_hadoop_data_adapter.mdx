## Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing RPM installation of Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw`

    where `xx` is the server version number.

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw`

    where `xx` is the server version number.
