Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper 2.1.0 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Join Pushdown: If a query has a join between two foreign tables from the same remote server, you can now push that join down to the remote server instead of fetching all the rows for both the tables and performing a join locally. |
