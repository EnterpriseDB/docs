| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature     | Push down aggregates to remote HDFS servers: Push aggregates to the remote HDFS server instead of fetching all of the rows and aggregating them locally.  This gives a performance boost for cases where aggregates can be pushed down. |
| Enhancement | Add support for NUMERIC data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Bug fix     | Do not push expressions evaluating as non-builtin data types.                                                                                                                                                                           |
