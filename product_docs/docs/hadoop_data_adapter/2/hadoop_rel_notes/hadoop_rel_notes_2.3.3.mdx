| Enhancement | Added support for PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server [*], and EDB Postgres Extended Server [*] 18.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Enhancement | Added the ability to build the `hdfs_fdw` extension directly from PostgreSQL's `contrib` directory.                                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement | Added SSL-related foreign server options (`ssl`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `sslTrustStore`, and `trustStorePassword`) to enable and manage secure connections to the remote Hadoop server.                                        |
| Bug Fix     | Addressed compiler warnings generated by newer GCC versions. These corrections address underlying code issues that could lead to undefined behavior, such as improper memory management or the use of uninitialized variables. |

[*] Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server 18 was added on 25 Nov 2025.
