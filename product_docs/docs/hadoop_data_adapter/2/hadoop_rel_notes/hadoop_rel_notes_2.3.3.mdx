| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | Added support for PostgreSQL 18.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Enhancement | Added the ability to build the `hdfs_fdw` extension directly from PostgreSQL's `contrib` directory.                                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement | Added SSL-related foreign server options (`ssl`, `useSystemTrustStore`, `sslTrustStore`, and `trustStorePassword`) to enable and manage secure connections to the remote Hadoop server.                                        |
| Bug Fix     | Addressed compiler warnings generated by newer GCC versions. These corrections address underlying code issues that could lead to undefined behavior, such as improper memory management or the use of uninitialized variables. |
| Deprecation | Removed support for versions 12 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server and PostgreSQL.                                                                                                               |
