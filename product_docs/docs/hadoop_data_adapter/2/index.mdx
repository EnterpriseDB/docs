The Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper (`hdfs_fdw`) is a Postgres extension that allows you to access data that resides on a Hadoop file system from EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The foreign data wrapper makes the Hadoop file system a read-only data source that you can use with Postgres functions and utilities or with other data that resides on a Postgres host.
