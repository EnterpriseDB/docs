If you have an existing installation of MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper that you installed using the EDB repository, you can use the `upgrade` command to update your repository configuration file and then upgrade to a more recent product version. To start the process, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the commands applicable to the operating system and package manager used for the installation:

## On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux or OL 8

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository
dnf upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product 
dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
```
## On RHEL or CentOS or OL 7:

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository 
yum upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product version
yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw edb-libmongoc-libs
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
```

## On SLES

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository
zypper upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product 
zypper upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
```

## On Debian or Ubuntu

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository
zypper upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product
apt-get --only-upgrade install edb-as<xx>-hdfs-fdw edb-libmongoc
# where <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
```

## On RHEL or CentOS 7 on PPCLE

```shell
# Update your edb.repo file to access the current EDB repository 
yum upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade to the latest version product version
yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw edb-libmongoc-at<yy>-libs     
# where:
# <xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number
# <yy> is Advance Toolchain major version number. For EDB Postgres 
# Advanced Server versions 10 to 11, <yy> must be 10 and for 
# EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later, <yy> must be 11. 
```
