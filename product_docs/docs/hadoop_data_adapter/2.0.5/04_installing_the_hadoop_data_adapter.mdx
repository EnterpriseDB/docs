## Installing the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper using an RPM Package

The RPM installation package for the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper is available from the EDB repository. Before installing the `forein data wrapper`, you must install the `epel-release` package:

> -   On RHEL or CentOS 7:
>
>     > `yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm`
>
> -   On RHEL or CentOS 8:
>
>     > `dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm`

Please note that you may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following commands:

> -   On RHEL or CentOS 7:
>
>     > `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`
>
> -   On RHEL or CentOS 8:
>
>     > `dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the `yum install` command to install the foreign data wrapper on RHEL or CentOS 7:

> -   On RHEL or CentOS 7:
>
>     > `yum install edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw`
>
> -   On RHEL or CentOS 8:
>
>     > `dnf install edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw`

where <span class="title-ref">xx</span> is the server version number.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu Host





To install the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

The following steps will walk you through on using the EDB apt repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

<!-- -->

    sudo su â€“

1.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

<!-- -->

    sh -c 'echo "deb
    https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release
    -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" >
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'

1.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

<!-- -->

    apt-get install apt-transport-https

1.  Add the EBD signing key:

<!-- -->

    wget -q -O - https://username:password
    @apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key \| apt-key add -

1.  Update the repository metadata:

<!-- -->

    apt-get update

1.  Install DEB package:

<!-- -->

    apt-get install edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw

where <span class="title-ref">xx</span> is the server version number.
