The key features of the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper are listed below:

## Where Clause Push-down

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrappper allows the push-down of `WHERE` clause to the foreign server for execution. This feature optimizes remote queries to reduce the number of rows transferred from foreign servers.

## Column Push-down

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper supports column push-down. As a result, the query brings back only those columns that are a part of the select target list.

## Automated Cleanup

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrappper allows the cleanup of foreign tables in a single operation using `DROP EXTENSION` command. This feature is specifically useful when a foreign table is set for a temporary purpose. The syntax is:

> `DROP EXTENSION hdfs_fdw CASCADE;`

For more information, see [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html).
