### On RHEL 7

Before installing the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper, you must install the following prerequisite packages, and request credentials from EDB:

Install the `epel-release` package:

 ```text
 yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
 ```

Enable the optional, extras, and HA repositories:

 ```text
 subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
 ```

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

 <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install `edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw`.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

 ```text
 yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
 ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

 ```text
 [edb]
 name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
 baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
 enabled=1
 gpgcheck=1
 repo_gpgcheck=1
 gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
 ```

**Installing Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the following commands to install the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper:

 ```
 yum install edb-as<xx>-hdfs_fdw
 ```

where `xx` is the server version number.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

The following steps will walk you through on using the EDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su –
    ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    On Debian 9 and Ubuntu:

     ```text
     sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
     ```

    On Debian 10:

    1.  Set up the EDB repository:

     ```text
     sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
     ```

    1.  Substitute your EDB credentials for the `username` and `password` in the following command:

     ```text
     sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
     ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://username:password
    @apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Install the package:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-as<xx>-hdfs-fdw
    ```

where `xx` is the server version number.
