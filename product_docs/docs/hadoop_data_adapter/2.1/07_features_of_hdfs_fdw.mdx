The key features of the Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper are listed below:

## Where Clause Pushdown

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrappper allows the pushdown of `WHERE` clause to the foreign server for execution. This feature optimizes remote queries to reduce the number of rows transferred from foreign servers.

## Column Pushdown

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper supports column pushdown. As a result, the query brings back only those columns that are a part of the select target list.

## Join Pushdown

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper supports join pushdown. It pushes the joins between the foreign tables of the same remote HIVE/SPARK server to that remote HIVE/SPARK server, thereby enhancing the performance.

## Automated Cleanup

Hadoop Foreign Data Wrappper allows the cleanup of foreign tables in a single operation using `DROP EXTENSION` command. This feature is specifically useful when a foreign table is set for a temporary purpose. The syntax is:

`DROP EXTENSION hdfs_fdw CASCADE;`

For more information, see [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html).
