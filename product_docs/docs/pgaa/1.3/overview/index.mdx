The Postgres Analytics Accelerator (PGAA) transforms PostgreSQL into a high-performance analytical engine. By integrating vectorized execution and open table formats, PGAA allows you to run complex OLAP queries directly on your data lake without leaving the Postgres ecosystem.

Use the following resources to understand the foundation of the accelerator and prepare your environment for production workloads.


* [Quickstart guide](quick_start): A step-by-step guide to install PGAA, create a storage location and read a table from our sample benchmark datasets.

* [Architecture](architecture): A deep dive into the decoupled compute and storage model. Learn how the PGAA extension interacts with Seafowl (the vectorized engine), and object storage providers like S3, GCS, and Azure Data Lake Storage.

* [Core concepts](concepts): Explore the fundamental principles of PGAA, including vectorized execution, columnar storage, and the difference between the DirectScan and CompatScan execution paths.

* [Compatibility](compatibility): A detailed matrix of supported PostgreSQL versions, operating systems, and cloud provider availability.
* [Known Issues](known_issues): A transparent list of current limitations, unsupported cases, and active bugs we are currently addressing.
