Released: 17 September 2026
Analytics Accelerator 1.3.1 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes, reflecting all changes since version 1.3.0:


## Features

- **Native CTAS support:** Simplify data migration and table creation with `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS), now supported directly using the `USING PGAA WITH` syntax. This allows you to create PGAA-managed tables directly from the results of a PostgreSQL query.
- **Spark Connect integration:** Offload heavy analytical queries to a remote Spark cluster using the new Spark Connect executor.
    - Use `pgaa.executor_engine` to switch between `seafowl` (default) and `spark_connect`.
    - Manage endpoints via `pgaa.spark_connect_url` and pass fine-grained JSON settings through `pgaa.spark_connect_extra_config`.
    - Execute Spark SQL statements verbatim on the cluster with the `pgaa.spark_sql()` function, which enables access to Spark-specific functions and Iceberg maintenance routines.
- **High-speed Iceberg replication with PGD 6.1+:** Significant performance gains for Iceberg tables with new support for merge-on-read using equality deletes. When `pgd.replicate_to_analytics` is enabled, changes are replicated more efficiently than traditional copy-on-write methods.
- **Expanded catalog support:** PGAA now supports AWS S3 Tables, allowing you to use the `pgaa.import_catalog` and `pgaa.attach_catalog` functions to manage S3-native Iceberg catalogs.
- **Dynamic worker management:** Implemented a new dynamic, AIDB-style management system that automatically scales and manages background worker processes based on active workload.


## Bug fixes

- Resolved an issue where the Seafowl object store cache duplicated entries when working with Iceberg REST tables.
- Fixed a failure in `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) statements when the PGAA access method was not explicitly set.
- Corrected a logic error that caused CTAS operations to erroneously attempt a DirectScan.
- Fixed a critical bug that caused data loss when using small replication lag settings.
- Resolved a race condition in transaction state management during the cancellation of a CTAS operation.
- Implemented LSN-based filtering to skip previously processed changes from PGD, preventing data duplication.
- Improved data flush plans by disabling unnecessary physical optimizers.
- Resolved a crash during CTAS operations for tables exceeding the `MAX_ROWS_PER_SYNC` limit.
- Improved efficiency by concatenating adjacent row changes when schemas are compatible and transactions are complete.
- Optimized equality deletes by removing unnecessary grouping logic, as primary keys are unique and changes are already squashed.
- Ensured the system correctly picks up and reflects "last updated" metadata timestamps for tables.
- Implemented non-durable LSN skipping to improve replication resilience.
- Added logic to automatically revert aborted or incomplete transactions to maintain data integrity.
- Added native data purging functionality to CTAS operations.
- Resolved an issue with the object store cache that occurred when reading from an Iceberg REST catalog.
- Fixed a lock-up issue where the PGAA autoupgrade worker could inadvertently lock PGD DDL replication.
- Resolved `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) failures on multi-node setups by preventing tuple insertions on PGD follower nodes.
- Fixed a segmentation fault that occurred when inserting `NULL` values during CTAS operations.
- Resolved an issue where tables could not be recreated after a purge by ensuring the sync collection is reset before CTAS execution.
- Corrected a misleading batch size estimation in the PGD replication writer to improve monitoring accuracy.
- Optimized the replication process by skipping unnecessary row squashing for batches that are exclusively append-only or remove-only.



## Infrastructure & other changes

- Enabled Prometheus metrics by default for the background Seafowl process via the `pgaa.autostart_seafowl_enable_metrics` and `pgaa.autostart_seafowl_metrics_host` parameters.
- Implemented immediate flushing for truncate and purge operations.
- Refactored internal synchronization logic for creating Delta and Iceberg targets.
- Removed the default internal object store and metastore from Seafowl.
- Introduced automated benchmarks to track and validate replication performance.
- Implemented various query and replication performance improvements specifically for the Iceberg format.
- Updated the Rust compiler to version 1.92.0 to leverage the latest language features and security patches.
- Removed the standalone metastore-agent operation mode and its transitive dependencies to simplify the architecture and reduce the extension's footprint.

## Deprecations

- The standalone Seafowl package has been discontinued; the Seafowl engine binary is now natively included within the PGAA package.
- Removed the `--one-off` and `--cli` Seafowl options.
- Removed internal support for several SQL statements within the Seafowl engine that are not utilized by PGAA, including:
    - Data modification: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
    - Schema management: `CREATE`/`DROP` for tables and schemas, and `ALTER RENAME`.
    - Table creation: `CREATE TABLE AS`, `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE`, and `CONVERT TO DELTA`.
    - Data export: `COPY TO`.
