Read-only queries are supported. You can't write directly to object storage.
This includes all Postgres built-in functions, statements, and types.
It also includes any of those provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server, depending on the distribution you choose to deploy.

You can't insert, update, delete, or otherwise modify data.
You can use `CREATE TABLE` but only to create a normal Postgres table on the node. The node is ephemeral and will be destroyed when you terminate it.
You can also use `CREATE TABLE... USING PGAA` to create an external table that references Delta Tables in S3-compatible object storage.

You must load data into the bucket out-of-band, either with your own ETL scripts or
using a third-party ETL provider that supports writing to Delta Tables or Iceberg tables.

See [Loading data](/pgaa/current/reference/loadingdata.mdx) for more details.

One exception is Postgres system tables, such as those used for storing users, roles, and grants.
These tables are stored on the local block device, which is included in backups and restores.
So you can use `CREATE USER`, `CREATE ROLE`, or `GRANT USAGE`, and these users/roles/grants will survive restarts and restores.
