## Catalog configuration  


### pgaa.metastore_sync_poll_rate_s

Steps how often to poll the current attached catalog state to consider catalog refreshes. Default is 60 seconds. Set to 0 to disable.
Link to `pgaa.attach_catalog()`.

Controls how often the background worker polls the external catalog for changes. The default value is 60 seconds.


### pgaa.metastore_sync_stale_duration_s

Defines the threshold at which the local metadata is considered stale. If the metadata in the local cache is older than this duration, the system prioritizes a refresh to ensure consistency with the data lake. The default value is 30 seconds.
