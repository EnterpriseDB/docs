description: Supported PostgreSQL types and internal PGAA state definitions.
---

The EDB Analytics Accelerator (PGAA) maps native PostgreSQL data types to optimized columnar formats in the data lake. This page lists the supported types and defines the status codes found in PGAA administrative views.

## Supported data types

### Full support (query and replication)

These types are natively recognized by both PostgreSQL and the Seafowl engine. They maintain their structural integrity and performance optimizations during offloading and replication.

- Numeric: `BIGINT`, `INTEGER`, `SMALLINT`, `NUMERIC`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `REAL`.
- Character/string: `TEXT`, `VARCHAR`, `CHAR`.
- Temporal: `TIMESTAMP`, `DATE`.
- Binary/object: `BYTEA`, `JSON`, `JSONB`, `UUID`.
- Logical: `BOOLEAN`.
- Custom: `ENUM`.

### Automatic fallback to UTF-8

Starting with PGAA 1.6, replication is more resilient to complex or unsupported data types. If a table contains a type not listed above, PGAA automatically falls back to a UTF-8 text representation. 

## Administrative enums and statuses

The following parameters and values are primarily found in PGAA administrative views. The table lists their description and supported values.

| Type      | Supported values    | Description | 
| --------- | ------------------- | ----------- |
| `pgaa.table_format` | `delta`, `iceberg`, and `parquet`. | The storage format of the table in object storage.  | 
| `pgaa.catalog_type` | `iceberg-rest` (Iceberg REST catalog), and `iceberg-s3tables` (AWS S3 Tables). | The type of catalog service. | 
| `pgaa.catalog_status` | `detached`, `attached`, `refresh_retry`, and `refresh_failed`. | The current synchronization health between Postgres and the catalog. | 
|  `pgaa.replication_status` | `disabled`, `initial_offload`, and `enabled`. | The state of data movement for Tiered Tables. | 
| `pgaa.task_status` | `pending`, `running`, `success`, and `failure`. | The lifecycle state of background worker tasks. |
