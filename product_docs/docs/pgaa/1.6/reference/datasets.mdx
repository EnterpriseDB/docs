You can use our public S3 buckets in AWS `us-east-1` that contains sample benchmarking datasets. 

!!! note

    Accessing these datasets can incur costs for data transfer and be subject to cross-region latencies.

You can query tables in these datasets by referencing them with their schema
name.

!!!note "Notes about ClickBench data"

Data columns (`EventData`) are integers, not dates.

You must quote ClickBench column names because they contain uppercase letters,
but unquoted identifiers in Postgres are case-insensitive. For example:

```sql
SELECT "Title" from clickbench.hits;
```
