To use the Postgres Analytics Accelerator (PGAA), you must install the extension on your PostgreSQL instance and enable the background worker for the query engine. See [Compatibility](overview/compatibility) for a full list of supported platforms.

## Downloading and installing the package

Download the package from the EDB repository:

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/standard/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

<TabContainer syncKey="platform">

<Tab title="Debian/Ubuntu" active>

```shell
sudo apt-get install -y postgresql-<version>-pgaa
```

Where `<version>` is your PostgreSQL version.

</Tab>

<Tab title="CentOS/RHEL">

```shell
sudo dnf install -y postgresql-<version>-pgaa
```

Where `<version>` is your PostgreSQL version.

</Tab>

</TabContainer>

## Enabling the extension 

To initialize PGAA, you must update your `postgresql.conf` file. Adding `pgaa` to `shared_preload_libraries` allows Postgres to manage the life cycle of the Seafowl query engine as a background worker.

1. Edit `postgresql.conf`:

    ```ini
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pgaa'
    pgaa.autostart_seafowl = on
    ```

1. Restart your PostgreSQL service to load the new library. Once restarted, log in to your Postgres instance and create the PGAA extension:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgaa CASCADE;
    ```

    Using `CASCADE` ensures that required dependencies, such as the Postgres File System (`PGFS`), are automatically installed.


## Verifying the installation

Confirm that the extension is active using the `\dx` meta-command or by calling the version function:

```sql
SELECT pgaa.pgaa_version();
```

Once installed, you can [Configure a storage location](storage_location) to grant PGAA access to your data lake.
