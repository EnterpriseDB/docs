Postgres Analytics Accelerator (PGAA) is a high-performance extension that enables PostgreSQL to query large-scale data stored in open table formats like Delta Lake, Apache Iceberg, and Parquet. By offloading heavy analytical queries to a vectorized execution engine, PGAA bridges the gap between operational databases and data lakes.


### Get started

* [Architecture](overview/architecture): Understand the core architecture and how the vectorized engine works.

* [Core concepts](overview/concepts): Understand the fundamental principles of vectorized execution, data lake integration, and DirectScan.

* [Installation and Configuration](installing): Step-by-step instructions for installing the extension and configuring a storage location.

* [Quickstart guide](overview/quick_start): Install PGAA, create a storage location and read table from our sample benchmark datasets.

### Using PGAA

* [Read from object storage](read_no_catalog): Connect directly to S3, GCS, or Azure Blob Storage to query Parquet, Delta, or Iceberg files via a PGFS storage location.

* [Read using Iceberg catalogs](catalog): Integrate with external Iceberg REST catalogs to manage table metadata.

* [Use CTAS to write to object storage](ctas): Use `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT` (CTAS) to export PostgreSQL data into optimized lakehouse formats in your object store.

### Performance & Optimization

* [Accelerate with Spark](spark): Offload massive datasets and complex distributed joins to a remote Spark cluster via Spark Connect.

* [Monitor your analytical tables](monitoring): Use built-in functions to track snapshot sizes, file counts, and identify unoptimized tables.

* [Optimize performance](optimize_performance): Fine-tune DirectScan vs. CompatScan behavior and perform essential maintenance like Compaction, Z-Ordering, and Vacuuming.

### Reference

* [Configuration parameters](reference/configuration_parameters): The behavior of the PGAA extension is governed by Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) variables. These parameters allow you to switch executors, enable performance optimizations, and manage security credentials.

* [Functions](reference/functions): PGAA introduces a suite of SQL functions for administrative tasks, such as mapping new tables, monitoring storage health, and launching maintenance background jobs.

* [Table options](reference/table_options): When mapping or creating analytical tables, specific options allow you to define how data is read from or written to your object store.

* [Data types](reference/data_types): PGAA maps native PostgreSQL data types to optimized columnar formats in the data lake.

* [Datasets](reference/datasets): Access pre-configured schemas and data loading instructions for analytical datasets to baseline your performance.
