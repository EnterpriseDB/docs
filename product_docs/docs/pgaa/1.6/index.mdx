Use the **Analytics Accelerator (PGAA)** to explore the analytical capabilities built on EDB Postgres®. This accelerator helps you understand core concepts, explore key technologies such as EDB Postgres® Lakehouse, and learn how to implement analytics with EDB Hybrid Manager (HM).

We integrate modern data architectures and open standards with the reliability and flexibility of Postgres to help you unlock valuable insights.

## Navigating the analytics accelerator

The accelerator organizes content into four areas:

- **Conceptual foundations**
Build your understanding of analytics principles and EDB’s approach.

- **EDB core analytics technologies**
Learn about EDB solutions and technologies that power our analytics offerings.

- **Practical guidance and solutions**
Find use cases, persona-based guides, how-to articles, and tutorials.

- **Product-specific implementations**
Access documentation for how these analytics capabilities surface and are managed in EDB products, such as EDB Hybrid Manager.

## Conceptual foundations

Understand the principles and strategies behind modern data analytics and EDB’s approach.

- [Generic analytics concepts](/pgaa/current/generic-concepts)
Learn about data architectures (Data Warehouse, Data Lake, Lakehouse) and foundational technologies (columnar storage, vectorized engines, and others).

- [EDB analytics concepts](/pgaa/current/analytics-concepts)
Explore EDB’s vision for Postgres® analytics and how EDB leverages core technologies.

Review in-depth explanations of EDB analytical features, design choices, and advanced topics across the sections below.

## EDB core analytics technologies

Learn about EDB’s analytics technologies and how they extend Postgres®.

- [Lakehouse clusters (EDB Postgres Lakehouse overview)](/pgaa/current/lakehouse)
Review the EDB Postgres® Lakehouse solution and its components for enabling analytics on object storage.

- [Apache Iceberg® with EDB solutions](/pgaa/current/iceberg)
Understand how EDB solutions use Apache Iceberg® to manage large analytical datasets.

- [Delta Lake with EDB solutions](/pgaa/current/delta_lake)
Learn how EDB Postgres® interacts with Delta tables to enable reliable data lakes.

- [Tiered tables with EDB Postgres](/pgaa/current/tiered_tables)
Manage data across storage tiers using EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and Lakehouse capabilities to optimize cost and performance.

## Use Anywhere (Manual/Reference)

- Lakehouse overview: [Lakehouse clusters](/pgaa/current/lakehouse)
- Open formats: [Apache Iceberg®](/pgaa/current/iceberg), [Delta Lake](/pgaa/current/delta_lake)

## How-Tos (Runbook-Aligned)

These guides mirror the runbook flows and code examples.

— Core How-Tos
- How-to  [Read with/without a catalog](/pgaa/current/how-to-lakehouse-read-with-without-catalog)
- How-to  [Read/write without a catalog](/pgaa/current/how-to-read-write-without-catalog)
- How-to  [Reads/writes with a catalog](/pgaa/current/how-to-iceberg-reads-writes-with-catalog)
- How-to  [Integrate a third-party catalog](/pgaa/current/how-to-third-party-catalog)


## Where to start

- Start with [Generic analytics concepts](/pgaa/current/generic-concepts) and [Lakehouse overview](/pgaa/current/lakehouse) to understand core ideas.
- If you’re experimenting with external data, use the No Catalog how-tos.
- If you’re integrating with PGD/Tiered Tables or catalogs, follow the PGD and Catalog how-tos.

Postgres Lakehouse is built using a number of technologies:

-   PostgreSQL
-   [Seafowl](https://seafowl.io/), an analytical database
-   [Apache Datafusion®](https://datafusion.apache.org/), the query engine used by Seafowl
-   [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) (and specifically [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs)),
for implementing the storage and retrieval layer of Delta Tables




## EDB’s vision for analytics on Postgres

EDB implements modern analytics patterns through the Analytics Accelerator (PGAA), enabling Postgres to serve as a unified platform for both operational and analytical workloads.

Key principles:

-   Perform analytics **close to operational data**, reducing data movement and latency
-   Use **open formats** and **vectorized query engines** for fast analytics on object storage
-   Support **data tiering** to balance cost and performance
-   Separate **compute and storage** to allow independent scaling
-   Manage the entire stack via Hybrid Manager

## Key EDB solutions and technologies

### EDB Postgres Lakehouse

Lakehouse architecture enables EDB Postgres to query data in object storage:

-   Lakehouse nodes query data in **open table formats** (Iceberg, Delta Lake)
-   Vectorized query execution powered by [Apache Datafusion®](https://datafusion.apache.org/)
-   Columnar storage formats such as **Parquet**
-   Separation of compute and storage
