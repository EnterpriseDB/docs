This terminology list includes terms associated with Analytics Accelerator (PGAA) that you might be unfamiliar with.

1. Core Platform Components
PGAA (Postgres Analytics Accelerator): The high-performance query engine for EDB Postgres AI. it uses vectorized execution and columnar data processing to accelerate analytical (OLAP) queries.

PGFS (Postgres File System): A specialized cloud-native storage layer that manages how data is stored and accessed in object storage, providing the bridge between Postgres and the data lake.

Lakekeeper: EDB’s metadata and catalog service. it tracks the location and schema of iceberg tables, ensuring the query engine can find and read data stored in the lakehouse.

Postgres Lakehouse: The overarching architecture that allows users to store and query vast amounts of data in object storage (S3/GCS/Azure Blob) using the power of Postgres.

2. Data Management & Automation
Catalogs: The central source of truth for table metadata.

Internal Catalog: managed by Lakekeeper to track tiered and lakehouse tables within the EDB environment.

External/Third-Party Catalogs: support for integration with services like AWS Glue or REST-based catalogs, allowing engines like Spark or Trino to share data with Postgres.

Tiered Tables: tables that span across different storage media. recent "hot" data stays in local storage for fast updates, while "cold" historical data is offloaded to object storage.

Autopartition: an automation feature for tiered tables that handles the creation and lifecycle of partitions as data ages and moves from operational storage to the lakehouse.

Data Tiering: the strategic classification of data into hot, warm, and cold tiers based on access frequency to optimize the balance between performance and cost.

3. Key Technologies
Vectorized Query Optimization: a method where the engine processes data in batches (vectors) rather than row-by-row, leveraging modern CPU instructions (SIMD) for much faster math and aggregations.

Open Table Formats (Iceberg & Delta Lake): standardized formats that bring database-like features—such as ACID transactions, time travel, and schema evolution—to files stored in a data lake.

Columnar Storage Formats: formats like Apache Parquet that store data by columns, allowing for high compression and significantly reducing I/O by only reading the specific data needed for a query.

Separation of Storage and Compute: a design where compute nodes are independent of the storage layer (object storage), allowing you to scale query power without paying for more local disk space.

4. Analytical & AI Concepts
OLAP vs. OLTP: * OLTP (Online Transaction Processing): optimized for fast, frequent transactions (e.g., standard Postgres).

OLAP (Online Analytical Processing): optimized for complex analysis on large volumes of data (e.g., PGAA).

ETL vs. ELT: * ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): transforming data before it reaches the database.

ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): loading raw data into the lakehouse first and using PGAA's power to transform it later.

Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): an AI architecture that retrieves relevant data from your Postgres Lakehouse to provide accurate, grounded context to a Large Language Model (LLM).

Vector Embeddings: numerical representations of unstructured data (like text or images) that allow for semantic search and similarity comparisons.
