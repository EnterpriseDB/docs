Released: 4 February 2026

Analytics Accelerator 1.6 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

## Features

### Performance & query optimization

- Added support for join and group-by pushdowns to the vectorized engine even when falling back to CompatScan. These can be toggled via the `pgaa.enable_join_pushdown` and `pgaa.enable_groupby_pushdown` configuration parameters.
- Updated DataFusion to version 51 for improved stability and query performance.
- Added native support for `NOT LIKE` and `NOT ILIKE` operators.

### Replication & data types

- Added support for `BYTEA` replication and schema inference.
- Introduced support for replicating Postgres array types to native lakehouse types, including specific support for `BPCHAR` and `UUID` arrays.
- Added a fallback mechanism that converts unsupported types to `TEXT` to prevent replication failures.
- Integrated the option `pgd.purge_analytics_target` into the `pgaa.enable_analytics_replication` and `pgaa.convert_to_tiered_table` functions to purge existing analytics before replicating. 

### Catalog & storage management

- Added support for Parquet format for a PGFS storage location using `file://` and `s3://` protocols.
- Added a `cascade` parameter to `pgaa.detach_catalog()`, which drops all tables managed by the catalog before detaching. 
- Included a safety improvement to the `pgaa.delete_catalog()` function, by making it require an explicit `cascade := true` parameter if tables are present, preventing accidental metadata loss.
- Added automated catalog connection checks for the `pgaa.add_catalog()` and `pgaa.update_catalog()` functions.
- Added the `pgaa.list_catalog_tables()` function which allows you to explore the all tables and views in a catalog without having to import or attach the tables to your local database first, with optional namespace filtering.
- Added the `pgaa.drop_catalog_tables()` function, which removes all local PostgreSQL table and view definitions managed by a specific Iceberg catalog, without affecting tables in the remote Iceberg catalog.
- Added namespace filtering to `pgaa.import_catalog()`, allowing for selective schema imports.
- Changed default value for configuration parameters such as `pgaa.tiered_table` and `pgaa.purge_data_if_exists` to `true` if specified without an explicit value.

## Bug fixes

- Resolved a memory leak during Create Table As Select (CTAS) operations that caused Out-of-Memory (OOM) errors on large tables.
- Fixed memory leaks occurring during internal table mapping operations.
- Fixed an issue where tiered table DML failed when using qualifiers without partition columns.
- Removed an unnecessary table existence warning from the CTAS hook.
- Fixed a duplicate key error triggered when repeatedly setting the `tiered_table` option.

## Deprecations

- Upgrade paths from versions prior to 1.3 have been removed. Users on older versions must first upgrade to PGAA 1.3.1 before moving to 1.6.0.
- The `pgaa.experimental_enable_spark_parquet_tables` configuration parameter is now deprecated and defaults to `TRUE`, as both Seafowl and Spark engines natively support Parquet.
