{{name.ln}} is designed to support the two most common configurations of highly available or disaster recovery enabled clusters. These configurations are:

- **Local HA**: This configuration uses three nodes in a single data center. The nodes will be  replicating each other and any connection into a node will be routed to an appropriately active node in the cluster.

This configuration is designed to support high availability. If one of the nodes fails, the other nodes will continue to operate and the failed node can be repaired and reintroduced into the cluster.

- **HA with Remote DR**: This configuration uses three nodes in two data centers. The nodes will be replicating each other and any connection into a node will be routed to an appropriately active node in the cluster. If a node fails, the other nodes will continue to operate and the failed node can be repaired and reintroduced into the cluster. In this configuration, one of the nodes is in a different data center than the other two nodes.

This configuration is designed to support disaster recovery. If one of the data centers fails, the other data center will continue to operate and the failed data center can be repaired and reintroduced into the cluster.
