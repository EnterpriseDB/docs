This section will help you get up and running quickly with {{name.ln}} ready. In this section, you will learn how to set up a {{name.sn}} cluster using Docker. This is a great way to get started with {{name.ln}} and see how it works. You can use this setup for development and testing purposes.

We'll be bringing up a 3 node cluster for local high availability.
