title: Configuration
---

Besides being mandatory for the customer `id`, the Lasso
configuration file also allows you to omit most of the command line
options that your environment might require. (You can see a list of all
the command-line options in [Usage](usage).)

Lasso looks for configuration files in the following paths, in this
order, and uses the first match:

1. `./edb-lasso.cfg` in the same directory where Lasso is running
2. `./edb-lasso.conf` in the same directory where Lasso is running
3. `$HOME/.edb-lasso.conf`
4. `/etc/edb-lasso.conf`

A template file for the configuration file looks like this:

```

    [customer]
    ; the "Company code" from the customer page in the EDB Portal
    id=
    ; the "Token" from the customer page in the EDB Portal
    ;    since Lasso 4.17.0, the token is no longer mandatory.
    token=
    ; the depth of the Lasso report. Must be one between: surface, shallow and deep
    depth=deep
    ; the environment of the server. Can be any string
    environment=

    [postgresql]
    ; Lasso uses the following connection string parameters to connect to your

    ; port=
    ; hostname can be a host or a socket directory
    ; hostname=/var/run/postgresql

    ; session variable to control timeout on lock waits
    ; lock_timeout=3s

    ; statement_timeout=5min

    [environment]
    ; PostgreSQL binaries directory. Lasso will try to detect this automatically if
    ; not set

    [barman]
    ; path to barman.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [repmgr]
    ; path to repmgr.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    [efm]
    ; path to efm.properties, if using a non-default one

    [xdb]
    ; path to xdb_pubserver.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; pubserver_configuration=
    ; path to xdb_subserver.conf, if using a non-default one
    ; subserver_configuration=

    [pgbouncer]
    ; path to pgbouncer.ini, if using a non-default one
    ; configuration=

    ; configuration=

    ; configuration=
```

You can use this template to set up your configuration file. Uncomment 
the desired parameters and set their values according to your
environment.

On Linux, you can find that same template configuration
file at `/etc/edb-lasso.conf.templ`.

You can see more details about how each of these arguments is used in
[Report types](report-types).
