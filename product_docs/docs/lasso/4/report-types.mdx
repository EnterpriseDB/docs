## Local/full PostgreSQL report

This type of report is useful when the server has a PostgreSQL cluster
that's up, running, and accessible. In addition to all information that's
gathered in the system-only report, it also gathers configurations
and metrics from the PostgreSQL instance.

For this report, you need to run Lasso as the postgres or enterprisedb user.

!!! Important
The same user that runs the Postgres server process must run the command. 
The user must have permission to write
in the current working directory.
!!!

A standard Lasso run consists of:

```
    lasso
```

By default, Lasso tries to connect using Unix sockets, the default
Postgres port (5432), the default database, and the user name (postgres).
You can specify different values at the command line:

```
    lasso -p PORT DATABASE_NAME USER_NAME
```

By default, Lasso looks for a Unix socket under `/var/run/postgresql/`,
but you can specify any socket listed by
`SHOW unix_socket_directories` using the `-H` argument. For example,
usually a Lasso report for the EDB Postgres Advanced Server is
gathered with:

```
    lasso -H /tmp -p 5444 edb
```

If a password is required, it's a common practice to create a `~/.pgpass`
file for the postgres or enterprisedb operating system user. You can
find more details about the `.pgpass` file [in the PostgreSQL
documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).
As Lasso connects to the database using `libpq`, then Lasso uses the
`.pgpass` file as appropriate.

If the `.pgpass` file isn't found or a corresponding entry for the
database connection doesn't exist in the `.pgpass` file, then Lasso
prompts for a password. Alternatively, you can specify a password using
the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable:

```
    PGPASSWORD=xxxx lasso -p PORT DATABASE_NAME USER_NAME
```

On Windows, typically you run Lasso like this:

```
    lasso-windows-X.Y.Z.exe -H IP_ADDRESS -p PORT --password PASSWORD DATABASE_NAME USER_NAME
```

For a list of all command line arguments detailed in [Usage](usage),
run:

```
    lasso --help
```

You can specify Postgres settings in the Lasso configuration file,
under the `postgresql` setting. For more details, see
[Configuration](configuration).

!!! Important
When run on a local instance, Lasso
requires a user that belongs to the pg_monitor role, which is available
in Postgres 10 and later. For earlier versions of Postgres, you must run as
a superuser. For more information, see 
[Default Roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.
!!!

Lasso transparently gathers information related to
all supported versions of EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and pglogical.


## Remote/database-only PostgreSQL report

If you need to gather data from a remote PostgreSQL instance, you can
run a remote PostgreSQL report.

As explained in [Local/full PostgreSQL report](#localfull-postgresql-report), you can change the 
connection-string parameters of Lasso. For example, to gather a PostgreSQL report
from a remote server located in the IP 192.168.0.10 running on port
5433, you can invoke Lasso from another server as follows:

```
    lasso -H 192.168.0.10 -p 5433
```

This type of report brings only PostgreSQL-related info from the
PostgreSQL instance that Lasso was connected to. It means it can't
gather files like `postgresql.conf` and `pg_hba.conf`. It also can't
gather configurations and metrics from the underlying
operational system or information from PostgreSQL-related tools, like EFM
configuration files. With that in mind, we recommend running a
local PostgreSQL report, if possible.

!!! Important
This is the only option for gathering PostgreSQL information
from an instance hosted on a DBaaS provider such as EDB Big Animal or
Amazon RDS.
!!!

!!! Important
This is the only option for gathering PostgreSQL information
from an instance running under Kubernetes.
!!!


## Barman report

Lasso can run on systems where Barman is installed. In that
case, it gathers Barman-related information, as well as system information,
that helps during analysis.

!!! Important
You must run the command as the same user that runs the
Barman process, and you must have enough permission to write in the current
working directory. If you installed Barman using RPM/DEB packages,
Barman is configured to run as the barman user.
!!!

The Barman report is enabled by default if Lasso runs as the barman user
and looks for configuration files in the expected locations, typically
`/etc/barman.conf`. Execute `man 5 barman` for details.

In general, if you installed Barman using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso as the barman user.

### Managing custom installations of Barman

If you have custom installations of Barman, you can enable the barman report
by passing the `--barman` option to Lasso:

```
    lasso --barman
```

You can also point to a specific global configuration file by using the
`--barman-configuration` option:

```
    lasso --barman-configuration /opt/barman/barman.conf
```


## Replication Manager (repmgr) report

Lasso can run on systems where repmgr is installed. In that
case, it gathers repmgr-related information.

In general, if you installed repmgr using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the repmgr configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the repmgr
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided to the `--repmgr-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by packages. For example, in CentOS/RHEL packages, the
configuration file is usually put under `/etc/repmgr/<PG_VERSION>/repmgr.conf`.
Lasso inspects those folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the
first repmgr configuration file that it finds.
3. Check if a `repmgr.conf` file exists in the current directory.
4. Check if a `/etc/repmgr.conf` file exists.
5. Check the path given by `pg_config --sysconfdir` for the `repmgr.conf` file.
6. Check the output of `systemctl cat <service_name>`, where `<service_name>` is
any service whose name contains `repmgr`, and try to get the `repmgr.conf`
file from the service unit file. It checks the units in descending order, just
as it does in approach 2, and uses the first match.

### Managing custom installations of repmgr

You can point to a specific repmgr configuration file by using the
`--repmgr-configuration` option:

```
    lasso --repmgr-configuration /opt/repmgr/repmgr.conf
```

We recommend this approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct repmgr configuration file instead of trying to find it.


## Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) report

Lasso can run on systems where PEM is installed. In that
case, it also gathers PEM-related information, like some configuration
files and information about services.

Lasso inspects the well-known paths for configuration files
as well as well-known service names. If you have custom PEM installations,
Lasso doesn't gather the related information.


## Failover Manager (EFM) report

Lasso can run on systems where EFM is installed. In that
case, it gathers EFM-related information.

In general, if you installed EFM using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the EFM configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the EFM
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided to the `--efm-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by packages. The configuration file is usually put
under `/etc/edb/efm-<EFM_VERSION>/efm.properties`. Lasso inspects
those folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the first EFM
configuration file that it finds.
3. Check the output of `systemctl cat <service_name>`, where `<service_name>` is
replaced with any service whose name starts with `edb-efm-`. Then try to get the
`efm.properties` file from the service unit file. It checks the units in
descending order, just as it does in approach 2, and uses the first match.

### How Lasso finds the EFM binary

Lasso inspects the paths provided by packages. The binary file is
usually put under `/usr/edb/efm-<EFM_VERSION>/bin/efm`. Lasso inspects
these folders, if they exist, in descending order, and uses the first EFM binary
file that it finds.

### Managing custom installations of EFM

You can point to a specific EFM configuration file by using the
`--efm-configuration` option:

```
    lasso --efm-configuration /opt/EFM/efm.properties
```

We recommend this approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct EFM configuration file instead of trying to find it.


## Patroni report

Lasso can run on systems where Patroni is installed. In that
case, it gathers Patroni-related information.

In general, if you installed Patroni using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the Patroni configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the Patroni
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided to the `--patroni-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by packages. For DEB packages, the configuration
file is usually `/etc/patroni/config.yml`, while for RPM packages, the
configuration file is usually `/etc/patroni/patroni.yml`.
3. Check the running processes. If there is any `patroni` processes running,
then the configuration file is passed as the last argument.


## Replication Server (xDB) report

Lasso can run on systems where xDB is installed. In that
case, it gathers xDB-related information.

In general, if you installed xDB using EDB-certified RPM packages or the
bitrock installer, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the xDB configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
configuration files. It uses the first one it finds.

On Linux:

1. Use the ones provided to the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and
`--xdb-subserver-configuration` options, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 RPM package and bitrock installer. The
configuration files are usually put under `/etc/edb/xdb/etc`. Lasso
inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and
`xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.
3. Check the paths provided by xDB 6 RPM package and bitrock installer, which are
usually `/usr/ppas-xdb-<XDB_VERSION>/etc` and `/opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/etc`,
respectively. Lasso inspects these folders and, if they exist, uses the
`xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf` files found under the folder. In the
case of RPM packages, as there can be a lot of folders, they're inspected
from newest XDB version to oldest.

On Windows:

1. Use the ones provided to the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and
`--xdb-subserver-configuration` options, if given.
2. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and
`xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.
3. Check the paths provided by xDB 7 packages. The configuration files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\etc`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `xdb_pubserver.conf`
and `xdb_subserver.conf` files found under that folder.

### How Lasso finds the xDB binary

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the xDB
binary file. It uses the first one it finds.

On Linux:

1. Check the paths provided by the xDB 7 RPM package and bitrock installer. The
binary files are usually put under `/etc/edb/xdb/bin`. Lasso
inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar` file found under that
folder.
2. Check the paths provided by the xDB 6 RPM package and bitrock installer, which are
usually `/usr/ppas-xdb-<XDB_VERSION>/bin` and `/opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/bin`,
respectively. Lasso inspects these folders and, if they exist, uses the
`edb-repcli.jar` file found under the folder. For RPM packages, as there
can be a lot of folders, they're inspected from newest XDB version to oldest.

On Windows:

1. Check the paths provided by the xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar` file found
under that folder.
2. Check the paths provided by the xDB 7 packages. The binary files are usually
put under `<drive>:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`.
Lasso inspects this folder, if it exists, and uses the `edb-repcli.jar`
file found under that folder.

### Managing custom installations of xDB

You can point to a specific xDB publication or subscription server configuration
file by using the `--xdb-pubserver-configuration` and `--xdb-subserver-configuration`
options.

On Linux:

```
    lasso --xdb-pubserver-configuration /opt/xDB/pubserver.conf --xdb-subserver-configuration /opt/xDB/subserver.conf
```

On Windows:

```
    lasso-windows-X.Y.Z.exe --xdb-pubserver-configuration C:\\xDB\pubserver.conf --xdb-subserver-configuration C:\\xDB\subserver.conf
```

We recommend this approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct xDB configuration files instead of trying to find it.


## PgBouncer report

Lasso can run on systems where PgBouncer is installed. In that
case, it gathers PgBouncer-related information.

In general, if you installed PgBouncer using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, and PgBouncer instances are up and running, all you need to do is
execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the PgBouncer configuration file

Lasso uses the list of running processes to identify the PgBouncer processes
and uses the configuration file retrieved from there.

You can also specify one or more PgBouncer configuration files with
the Lasso argument `--pgbouncer-configuration`. It's mainly useful in scenarios
where a PgBouncer instance isn't running or if Lasso can't
detect the configuration file from the process list.

Lasso collects information from all identified PgBouncer instances.


## HARP report

Lasso can run on systems where HARP is installed. In that
case, it gathers HARP-related information.

In general, if you installed HARP using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the HARP configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the HARP
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided to the `--harp-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check if the `/etc/harp/config.yml` file exists.

### Managing custom installations of HARP

You can point to a specific HARP configuration file by using the `--harp-configuration`
option:

```
    lasso --harp-configuration /opt/harp/config.yml
```

We recommend this approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct HARP configuration file instead of trying to find it.

### Running Lasso on a HARP proxy node

The HARP proxy nodes don't have a Postgres or EDB Postgres Advanced Server service running on them, as they're 
intended only as a proxy for connections coming in from the applications.

When using Lasso to gather information from a HARP proxy node, you must use the
`--system-only` option so it doesn't try to connect to the database server.


## PGD Proxy report

Lasso can be run on systems where PGD Proxy is installed. In that
case, it gathers PGD Proxy-related information.

In general, if you installed PGD Proxy using EDB-certified RPM and DEB
packages, all you need to do is execute Lasso.

### How Lasso finds the PGD Proxy configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the PGD Proxy
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided through `--pgd-proxy-configuration` option, if given
2. Check if `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml` file exists

### Managing custom installations of PGD Proxy

You can point to a specific PGD Proxy configuration file by using the
`--pgd-proxy-configuration` option:

```
    lasso --pgd-proxy-configuration /opt/pgd-proxy/config.yml
````

We recommend this approach, as it guarantees Lasso will use
the correct PGD Proxy configuration file instead of trying to find it automatically.

### Running Lasso on a PGD Proxy node

There are cases where the PGD Proxy nodes don't have a Postgres/EDB Postgres Advanced Server service running
on them. They're intended only as a proxy for connections coming in from the
applications.

When using Lasso to gather information from a standalone PGD Proxy node, you must
use the `--system-only` option so it doesn't try to connect to the database server.


## etcd report

Lasso can run on systems where etcd is installed. In that
case, it gathers etcd-related information.

### How Lasso finds the etcd configuration file

Lasso uses the following approach while trying to identify the etcd
configuration file. It uses the first one it finds.

1. Use the one provided to the `--etcd-configuration` option, if given.
2. Check if the `/etc/etcd/etcd.conf` file exists.


## System-only report

Lasso can also run on systems where Postgres or
Barman aren't installed to gather all relevant information
regarding the underlying operating system.

You can run a system-only report:

```
    lasso --system-only
```

!!! Important
Despite the argument being called `--system-only`, in this mode,
Lasso gathers information about all the aforementioned tools
except PostgreSQL/EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Barman.
!!!


## edb_wait_states report

For each database where the `edb_wait_states` extension is installed, Lasso
gathers important performance information from this extension and includes
it in the `postgresql/dbs/DBNAME/edb_wait_states/` folder.

The `edb_wait_states` extension requires defining a sampling range for
retrieving data, so Lasso exposes 2 arguments for defining the sampling
range: `--sampling-start` and `--sampling-end`. For example:

```
    lasso --sampling-start "2024-02-06 13:30:00+0000" --sampling-end "2024-02-06 14:00:00+0000"
```

In this case, the timestamps are in UTC. It's possible to specify a different timezone. For example:

```
    lasso --sampling-start "2024-02-06 10:30:00-0300" --sampling-end "2024-02-06 11:00:00-0300"
```

These arguments are ignored if the `edb_wait_states` extension isn't
installed.

If the `edb_wait_states` extension is installed and these arguments are
omitted, then Lasso considers `--sampling-start` as 1 hour from now and
`--sampling-end` as now.

For more details about the `edb_wait_states` extension, see the
[documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/wait_states/).
