Slony Replication is a primary-standby replication environment that is well-suited for large databases with a limited number of standby systems. It shares data in one direction only (from a primary node to a standby node), is cascading (a standby node may pass data to another standby node), and does not allow modification of data on standby nodes.

This guide acts provides information about installing and uninstalling Slony Replication. For detailed information about reference and usage, please visit the [project site](https://www.slony.info).
