EDB Slony is built from Slony-I and used for replicating EDB Postgres Advanced Server data. It is a primary-standby logical replication solution that is well-suited for large databases with a limited number of standby systems. It shares data in one direction only (from a primary node to a standby node), is cascading (a standby node may pass data to another standby node), and does not allow data to be modified on standby nodes.

This guide provides information about installing and uninstalling EDB Slony with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For detailed information about reference and usage, please visit the [project site](https://www.slony.info).
