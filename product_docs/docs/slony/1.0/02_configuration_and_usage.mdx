On a CentOS and Debian host, the configuration file (`slony-replication.ini`) is located in the `/etc/edb/slony-replication<xx>` directory. Use the configuration file to specify connection information for the master and standby nodes.

On a Windows host, the configuration files are named `master.conf.sample` and `slave.conf.sample`. They are located in the `/etc` directory under the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. Before configuring Slony Replication, you must rename the configuration files to `master.conf` and `slave.conf`.

For information about configuring a Slony Replication environment, please refer to the [Slony official project documentation](https://www.slony.info/adminguide/2.2/doc/adminguide/slony.pdf).

After specifying configuration options, you must start the Slony Replication service on all nodes of the replication environment. For detailed information about controlling a service, see EDB Advanced Server Installation Guide at the [EDB website](/epas/latest/).

After installing, configuring, and starting the Slony Replication on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system reboots.

To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the following command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system:

```text
/sbin/chkconfig service_name on
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

On a Debian-compatible Linux system, use the command:

```text
/usr/sbin/update-rc.d service_name enable
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

Please note that on a Windows system, the Slony Replication service is configured to autostart by default; you can use the `Service Properties` dialog to control the service startup type.
