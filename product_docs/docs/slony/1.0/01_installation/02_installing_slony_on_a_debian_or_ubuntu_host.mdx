You must install Advanced Server before installing Slony Replication. For details about installing and configuring Advanced Server, see [the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server). To install a package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials to access the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need EnterpriseDB credentials, [visit the EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

Please note that if you are using the pdf version of this document, using cut/paste to copy command may result in extra spaces or carriage returns in the pasted command. If a command fails, check the command carefully for additional characters.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

```text
sudo su –
```

1.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

```text
sh -c 'echo "deb https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

1.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

```text
apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

1.  Add the EDB signing key:

```text
wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
```

1.  Update the repository metadata:

```text
apt-get update
```

1.  Install DEB package:

```text
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-slony-replication
```

where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version.

For example, to install Slony Replication for Advanced Server version 12, execute the following command:

```text
apt-get install edb-as12-slony-replication
```

The following table lists the path of the service, installation, and configuration path.

| **Service File Path**                                      | **Installation File Path** | **Configuration File Path**                                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/lib/systemd/system/edb-as<xx>-slony-replication.service` | `/usr/lib/edb-as/<xx>`     | The configuration file named `slony-replication.ini` is located in `/etc/edb/slony-replication<xx>` |

Where &lt;xx> represents the Advanced Server version.
