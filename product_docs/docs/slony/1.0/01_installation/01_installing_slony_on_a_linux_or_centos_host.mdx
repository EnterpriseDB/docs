title: "Installing Slony Replication on a RHEL/CentOS Host"
---

<div id="performing_an_rpm_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

If you have used an RPM package to install Advanced Server on the host on which you will be installing Slony Replication, you have probably already created the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file and have EnterpriseDB credentials. If that is the case, you can install Slony Replication with the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

```text
yum -y install edb-as<xx>-slony-replication
```

where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version.

For example, to install Slony Replication for Advanced Server version 12, execute the following command:

```text
yum -y install edb-as12-slony-replication
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-slony-replication
```

where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version.

To install Slony Replication for Advanced Server version 9.5, you need to execute the `yum install ppas95-replication` command.

If you have not previously created the repository configuration file, follow the steps given below to create the file and to install Slony Replication.

Before creating the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, [visit the EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke one of the following platform-specific commands:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`; the file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

1.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to open this file. Ensure the `enabled` parameter value is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the credentials of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

1.  Save your changes to the configuration file and exit the editor.
2.  Execute the following commands to update the metadata:

```text
yum clean all
```

```text
yum makecache
```

1.  On RHEL/CentOS 8, you need to enable the `PowerTools` repo with the following command:

```text
dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
```

1.  Before installing Slony Replication, you must install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package by executing the following command:

    On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

```text
yum -y install epel-release
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf -y install epel-release
```

</div>

You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

</div>

1.  Then, use one of the following platform-specific command to install Slony Replication.

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

```text
yum -y install edb-as<xx>-slony-replication
```

where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version.

For example, to install Slony Replication for Advanced Server version 12, execute the following command:

```text
yum -y install edb-as12-slony-replication
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-slony-replication
```

where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version.

To install Slony Replication for Advanced Server version 9.5, you need to execute the `yum install ppas95-replication` command. The `ppas95-replication.service` path is `/usr/lib/systemd/system/ppas95-replication.service` and the installation path is `/usr/ppas-9.5`.

</div>

The following table lists the path of the service, installation, and configuration files.

| **Platform**        | **Service File Path**                                        | **Installation File Path** | **Configuration File Path**                                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RHEL/CentOS 6       | `/etc/init.d/edb-slony-replication-<xx>`                     | `/usr/edb/as<xx>`          | The configuration file `slony-replication.ini` is located in `/etc/edb/slony-replication<xx>` |
| RHEL/CentOS 7 and 8 | `/usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-slony-replication-<xx>.service` | `/usr/edb/as<xx>`          | The configuration file `slony-replication.ini` is located in `/etc/edb/slony-replication<xx>` |

In the above table, &lt;xx> represents the Advanced Server version.
