The EDB Klio Operator Helm chart from EDB allows you to deploy the Klio
Operator in your Kubernetes cluster. It is distributed as a private OCI image.

## Prerequisites

Before installing the Klio Operator, ensure you have:

-   **Helm** – see the [Helm installation guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
-   **Kubernetes** cluster with appropriate permissions
-   **Credentials** to access the registry hosting the Helm chart, the Klio operator
    image, and the Klio operand image. For the EDB registry, your username will be `k8s`
    and your password will be [your EDB Repos 2.0 token](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/repos/getting_started/with_web/get_your_token/).
-   **CloudNativePG Operator** already installed in your Kubernetes cluster.
    See the [CloudNativePG installation guide](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/current/installation_upgrade/).
-   **cert-manager** (optional, but strongly recommended for managing TLS certificates).
    See the [cert-manager installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/).
-   **Prometheus Operator** (optional, for operator monitoring).
    See the [Prometheus Operator installation guide](https://prometheus-operator.dev/docs/getting-started/installation/).

## Installation

For simplicity, the instructions below assume you've put the following values into environment variables:

- `$USERNAME` - will be `k8s` for the EDB registry.
- `$TOKEN` - will be your [EDB Repos 2.0 token](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/repos/getting_started/with_web/get_your_token/).
- `$NAMESPACE` - will be the namespace where you installed CNPG (`cnpg-system` is the default namespace for CNPG installations).

Example:

```sh
export USERNAME=k8s
export TOKEN=your-edb-token
export NAMESPACE=cnpg-system
```

### Step 1: Registry Authentication

First, authenticate with the EDB registry where the Helm chart is hosted:

```sh
helm registry login docker.enterprisedb.com -u "${USERNAME}" -p "${TOKEN}"
```

### Step 2: Create an Image Pull Secret

Create a Kubernetes secret to allow the operator to pull container images from
the registry:

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry klio-registry-secret \
  --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  "--docker-username=${USERNAME}" \
  "--docker-password=${TOKEN}" \
  "--namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

!!!info Namespace Selection

Select the namespace where you want to deploy the Klio Operator. This must be
the same namespace where CloudNativePG is deployed.
!!!

### Step 3: Install the Helm Chart

Deploy the Klio Operator to your cluster:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```sh
helm install klio-operator oci://docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s/klio-operator-chart \
  --version 0.0.11 \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}" \
  --set controllerManager.manager.image.pullSecrets[0].name=klio-registry-secret
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

### Step 4: Verify Installation

After installation, verify that the Klio Operator is running:

```sh
kubectl get pods -n "${NAMESPACE}" -l app.kubernetes.io/name=klio
```

You should see the operator pod in a `Running` state. Check the logs to ensure
there are no errors:

```sh
kubectl logs -n "${NAMESPACE}" deployment/klio-controller-manager -f
```

Verify that the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) were created:

```sh
kubectl get crds | grep klio.enterprisedb.io
```

You should see CRDs like `servers.klio.enterprisedb.io` and `pluginconfigurations.klio.enterprisedb.io`.

## Configuration

### Customizing the Installation

The chart is designed to be customizable, allowing you to configure multiple
aspects of the Klio Operator deployment, passing in values through a custom
`values.yaml` file or using the `--set` flag during installation.
See the [Helm documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) for more details
on how to customize and manage Helm charts.

#### Inspecting the Chart

Before installing, you can download the Helm chart to inspect its contents,
review the default values, and understand what resources it will create:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```sh
helm pull oci://docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s/klio-operator-chart --version 0.0.11
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

This downloads the chart as a `.tgz` file. Extract it to examine the templates,
default `values.yaml`, and other chart files:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```sh
tar -xzf klio-operator-chart-0.0.11.tgz
cd klio-operator-chart
cat values.yaml
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

## Upgrading

To upgrade the Klio Operator to a newer version:

```sh
helm upgrade klio-operator oci://docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s/klio-operator-chart \
  --version <NEW_VERSION> \
  --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

...where `<NEW_VERSION>` is the version you're upgrading to.

When upgrading, you can control how Helm handles values from the previous
installation. Please refer to the [Helm upgrade documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_upgrade/)
to understand the different options.

!!!warning CRD Upgrades

Helm does not automatically upgrade CRDs. If the new version includes CRD
updates, you may need to apply them manually. Check the release notes for
specific upgrade instructions.
!!!

## Uninstalling

To uninstall the Klio Operator:

```sh
helm uninstall klio-operator --namespace "${NAMESPACE}"
```

!!!warning Data Preservation

Uninstalling the operator does not automatically remove:

-   Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
-   Existing Klio resources (Servers, PluginConfigurations)
-   Persistent volumes containing backup data

To completely remove Klio from your cluster, you must manually delete these resources.
If you want to completely remove Klio, you must manually delete these resources.
!!!

To remove the CRDs after uninstalling:

```sh
kubectl delete crd servers.klio.enterprisedb.io
kubectl delete crd pluginconfigurations.klio.enterprisedb.io
```
