The Klio server is a central component of the Klio backup solution. It is
defined as the `Server` custom resource in Kubernetes, which creates a
StatefulSet running the Klio server application.

The Klio server is composed of three main containers:

-   `base`: Manages full and incremental backups using Kopia.
-   `wal`: Receives the stream of PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logs (WAL).
-   `nats`: Provides a work queue using NATS JetStream for async WAL processing.

An additional init container, `init`, is responsible for initializing the
Kopia repository and setting up the necessary configuration.

The base backups and WAL files are stored in multiple PersistentVolume attached
to the Klio server pod in the `/data/base` and `/data/wal` directories, respectively.

An additional cache defined by a PersistentVolume is used for the Kopia cache. This cache allows Kopia to
quickly browse repository contents without having to download from the storage
location.

The work queue is backed by NATS JetStream with file storage on a separate PersistentVolume mounted at `/queue`.
When a WAL file is received, the server publishes a notification to the queue, enabling asynchronous processing
of WAL files by consumers.

## Setting up a new Klio server

Setting up a Klio server involves creating a `Server` resource along with the
required Kubernetes secrets and certificates.

### Prerequisites

Before setting up a Klio server, ensure you have:

-   A Kubernetes cluster with the Klio operator installed
-   `kubectl` configured to access your cluster
-   [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) installed for certificate
    management (recommended)
-   Enough storage resources for the data and cache PersistentVolumeClaims
-   Enough storage resources for the queue PersistentVolumeClaim

### Required Components

A Klio server setup requires the following components:

1.  **Server Resource**: The main `Server` custom resource
2.  **TLS Certificate**: For secure communication
3.  **Encryption Password**: For encrypting backup data at rest
4.  **CA Certificate**: For client authentication via mTLS
5.  **Admin User Credentials**: Optional admin user for Kopia operations
6.  **Storage**: PersistentVolumeClaims for data, cache, and queue

### Step-by-step setup

#### 1. Create the Encryption Password Secret

The encryption password is used to encrypt backup data at rest:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-server-encryption
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  password: "bXktc2VjdXJlLXBhc3N3b3Jk" # my-secure-password
```

Apply the secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f encryption-secret.yaml
```

!!!tip

Use a strong, randomly generated password. This password is critical for
data security and recovery.
!!!

#### 2. Create CA Certificate

Using cert-manager, a CA certificate can be created by using the following
Certificate resource:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
  namespace: default
spec:
  selfSigned: { }
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: server-sample-ca
spec:
  commonName: server-sample-ca
  secretName: server-sample-ca

  duration: 2160h # 90d
  renewBefore: 360h # 15d

  isCA: true
  usages:
    - cert sign

  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

Apply the CA configuration with:

```
kubectl apply -f ca-configuration.yaml
```

In the previous example, the CA to be used for authentication is signed by a
self-signed issuer. This doesn't pose any security issue as this CA is only
used internally and trust is established through configuration.

The primary concern is the relationship between the client and the certificates
signed by the CA.

!!!info

The usage of a self-signed CA is not required by the Klio server. If your
PKI infrastructure already includes a CA for this scope, that CA can be used
for the Klio server, too.
!!!

#### 3. (Optional) Create Admin User Credentials

If you need admin access to the underlying Kopia server web interface
(mostly for debugging purposes), define the secret as follows:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-server-adm
  namespace: default
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
data:
  username: "YWRtaW4=" # admin
  password: "YWRtaW4tcGFzc3dvcmQ=" # admin-password
```

Apply the secret:

```bash
kubectl apply -f admin-credentials.yaml
```

#### 4. Create TLS Certificate

Using cert-manager, create a self-signed certificate (for development) or use
your organization's certificate issuer:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: selfsigned-issuer
  namespace: default
spec:
  selfSigned: { }
---
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: my-server-cert
  namespace: default
spec:
  secretName: my-server-tls
  commonName: my-server
  dnsNames:
    - my-server
    - my-server.default
    - my-server.default.svc
    - my-server.default.svc.cluster.local
  duration: 2160h # 90 days
  renewBefore: 360h # 15 days
  isCA: false
  usages:
    - server auth
  issuerRef:
    name: selfsigned-issuer
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

Apply the certificate configuration:

```bash
kubectl apply -f tls-certificate.yaml
```

!!!info

For production environments, use certificates signed by your organization's Certificate Authority (CA) or a trusted public CA instead of self-signed certificates.
!!!

#### 5. Create the Server Resource

Now create the main `Server` resource:

<!-- x-release-please-start-version -->

```yaml
apiVersion: klio.enterprisedb.io/v1alpha1
kind: Server
metadata:
  name: my-server
  namespace: default
spec:
  # Container image for the Klio server
  image: ghcr.io/enterprisedb/klio:v0.0.10
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  imagePullSecrets: []  # Add image pull secrets if needed

  # TLS configuration
  tlsSecretName: my-server-tls

  # Client authentication configuration
  caSecretName: server-sample-ca

  # Encryption password reference
  password:
    name: my-server-encryption
    key: password

  # Optional: Admin user for Kopia operations
  baseConfiguration:
    adminUser:
      name: my-server-adm

  # Cache storage configuration
  cacheConfiguration:
    pvcTemplate:
      storageClassName: standard  # Adjust to your storage class (use 'kubectl get storageclass' to see available options)
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi  # Adjust based on your needs

  # Data storage pvcTemplate (for backups and WAL)
  dataConfiguration:
    pvcTemplate:
      storageClassName: standard  # Adjust to your storage class (use 'kubectl get storageclass' to see available options)
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 100Gi  # Adjust based on your backup needs

  # Queue storage configuration (for NATS work queue)
  queueConfiguration:
    pvcTemplate:
      storageClassName: standard  # Adjust to your storage class
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi  # Adjust based on queue volume needs

  # Optional: Resource requirements
  resources:
    requests:
      memory: "1Gi"
      cpu: "500m"
    limits:
      memory: "2Gi"
      cpu: "2000m"
```

<!-- x-release-please-end -->

Apply the Server resource:

```bash
kubectl apply -f klio-server.yaml
```

#### 6. Verify the Server is Running

Check the status of your Klio server:

```bash
# Check the Server resource status
kubectl get server my-server -n default

# Check the StatefulSet
kubectl get statefulset my-server-klio -n default

# Check the Pod
kubectl get pods -l klio.enterprisedb.io/klio-server=my-server -n default

# View logs
kubectl logs -l klio.enterprisedb.io/klio-server=my-server -n default -f
```

The server should create a StatefulSet with a pod named `my-server-klio-0`.

## Advanced Configuration

The `.spec.template` field allows you to customize the Klio server's pod
template. You can add additional containers, volumes, or modify existing
settings.

!!!warning Advanced Users Only

The `.spec.template` field is primarily designed for advanced configurations.
While powerful, improper modifications can affect server functionality.
Always test changes in a non-production environment first.
!!!

!!!note

The `containers` field within `.spec.template.spec` is mandatory but will be
merged with the default Klio server containers `base` and `wal`. If you do not
need to add containers or modify the default ones, you must still include an
empty list.
!!!

### Node Affinity and Tolerations

To dedicate specific nodes for Klio workloads (e.g., for performance isolation
or to separate backup workloads from application workloads), you can use the
`template` field to define affinity and toleration rules.

```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      # Mandatory field; merged with default containers
      containers: []
      tolerations:
        # Allow scheduling on nodes tainted for Klio
        - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/klio
          operator: Exists
          effect: NoSchedule
      affinity:
        # Require nodes labeled for Klio
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
              - matchExpressions:
                  - key: node-role.kubernetes.io/klio
                    operator: Exists
```

See [Reserving Nodes for Klio Workloads](architectures.mdx#reserving-nodes-for-klio-workloads)
for details on node tainting.

### Monitoring

Refer to the [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.mdx#klio-server-with-opentelemetry)
documentation for setting up monitoring and telemetry for the Klio server.

## Encryption

Klio implements encryption at rest for both base backups and WAL files to
ensure data security throughout the backup lifecycle.

### Base Backups Encryption

Base backups are encrypted by Kopia using the encryption password provided in
the `password` secret reference. Kopia handles encryption transparently.

The encryption password is set during repository initialization and is required
for all subsequent backup and restore operations.

!!!warning Critical

Store the encryption password securely. Loss of this password means permanent
loss of access to all backup data. There is no password recovery mechanism.
!!!

### WAL Files Encryption

WAL files are encrypted using a master key derivation system with authenticated
encryption. The encryption process works as follows:

1.  **Master Key Generation**: A 32-byte master key is derived from the encryption
    password using PBKDF2
2.  **Key Enveloping**: The master key itself is encrypted using AES-256-GCM with a
    password-derived encryption key to protect the key at rest
3.  **Per-File Encryption**: Each WAL file is compressed and then encrypted using
    the master key with authenticated encryption before being stored

WAL files are first compressed using Snappy S2 compression, then encrypted to ensure both space
efficiency and security.

The same encryption password used for base backups encrypts the WAL files,
ensuring a unified security model across all backup artifacts.

### Encryption Password Rotation

Currently, encryption password rotation is not supported. To change the
encryption password, you would need to:

1.  Create a new Klio server with a new encryption password
2.  Perform new base backups to the new server
3.  Migrate to using the new server

!!!tip

Choose a strong encryption password from the start. Use a password manager or
key management system to generate and store a cryptographically secure password
(recommended: 32+ random characters).
!!!

### Encryption in Transit

In addition to encryption at rest, Klio protects both base backups and WAL files
during transmission using TLS (Transport Layer Security).

All communication between a Klio client and the Klio server is secured
with TLS:

-   **Base Backup Traffic**: Kopia client connections to the base backup server
    are encrypted using TLS, protecting backup data as it transfers to the Klio
    server
-   **WAL Streaming**: PostgreSQL instances streaming WAL files to the Klio server
    use gRPC over TLS, ensuring WAL data is encrypted during transmission

The TLS certificate is configured via the `.spec.tlsSecretName` field in the
Server resource, which references a Kubernetes secret containing the TLS
certificate and private key. This provides end-to-end encryption, ensuring that
backup data is protected both at rest and in transit.

## Authentication

Klio uses mTLS Authentication for securing access to both the base backup server
and the WAL streaming server. Authentication is handled by verify the client
certificates against the CA certificate which has been created when configuring
the Klio server.

### Creating a client-side certificate

To create a client-side certificate, you need a issuer that will sign all the
certificates with a CA known by the Klio server. Supposing that such a issuer is
called `server-sample-ca` and available in the current namespace, you can create
a client certificate with the following Certificate object:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: client-sample-tls
spec:
  secretName: client-sample-tls
  commonName: klio@cluster-1

  duration: 2160h # 90d
  renewBefore: 360h # 15d

  isCA: false
  usages:
    - client auth

  issuerRef:
    name: server-sample-ca
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

If used the example proposed in the [server configuration documentation
page](#2-create-ca-certificate), the issuer can be created with:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Issuer
metadata:
  name: server-sample-ca
spec:
  ca:
    secretName: server-sample-ca
```

### Admin User (Optional)

The optional admin user (`.spec.baseConfiguration.adminUser`) provides access to
the Kopia web interface for administrative and debugging purposes. This is
separate from the regular user authentication:

```yaml
spec:
  baseConfiguration:
    adminUser:
      name: my-server-adm  # Reference to kubernetes.io/basic-auth secret
```

The admin user secret must be of type `kubernetes.io/basic-auth`:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-server-adm
type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
data:
  username: <base64-encoded-username>
  password: <base64-encoded-password>
```

!!!info

The admin user is primarily intended for debugging and should be used sparingly
in production environments. Regular backup and restore operations use mTLS
certificates.
!!!

## Access Control Lists (ACLs)

Klio automatically configures Kopia's Access Control Lists (ACLs) during server
startup to provide fine-grained access control to backup snapshots. This
automation eliminates the need for manual ACL configuration.

### Automatic ACL Configuration

When the Klio server starts, it automatically:

1.  **Enables ACL support** in the Kopia repository
2.  **Creates a read-only user** (`snapshot_reader@klio`) with READ access to all snapshots
3.  **Configures the API server** to use the read-only user for backup catalog queries

This automation ensures that the Klio API server (used for backup observability
and catalog browsing) operates with minimal privileges, following the principle
of least privilege.

### How ACLs Work

Kopia's ACL system controls access to repository resources based on:

-   **User identity**: The authenticated username
-   **Resource type**: What is being accessed (e.g., snapshots, policies)
-   **Access level**: READ, APPEND, or FULL access

The automated ACL configuration creates the following rule:

```
User: snapshot_reader@klio
Access: READ
Target: type=snapshot (all snapshots in the repository)
```

This allows the API server to:

-   List all available backups
-   Read backup metadata and manifests
-   Browse backup catalogs
-   Provide observability into the backup state

However, the read-only user **cannot**:

-   Create new snapshots
-   Modify existing snapshots
-   Delete backups
-   Change repository configuration
-   Modify ACL rules

### User Configuration

From the authentication point-of-view, the `snapshot_reader@klio` user is not
special, and to use it you need a corresponding Secret containing a certificate
to be used for authentication.

Cert-manager can create such a secret with the following Certificate definition:

```yaml
apiVersion: cert-manager.io/v1
kind: Certificate
metadata:
  name: client-sample-tls
spec:
  secretName: client-sample-tls
  commonName: snapshot_reader@klio

  duration: 2160h # 90d
  renewBefore: 360h # 15d

  isCA: false
  usages:
    - client auth

  issuerRef:
    name: server-sample-ca
    kind: Issuer
    group: cert-manager.io
```

### API Server Integration

The Klio API server deployment is automatically configured to use the
`snapshot_reader@klio` user for all Kopia operations. This happens through
environment variable configuration in the API server deployment:

```yaml
- name: CLIENT_BASE_CLIENT_CERT_PATH
  value: /client-certs/tls.crt
- name: CLIENT_BASE_CLIENT_KEY_PATH
  value: /client-certs/tls.key
```

No manual configuration is required - the API server will automatically use the
restricted read-only access for all backup catalog queries.

### Benefits

The automated ACL configuration provides several benefits:

1.  **Security**: API server operates with minimal privileges
2.  **Simplicity**: No manual ACL commands required during setup
3.  **Consistency**: ACL configuration is standardized across all deployments
4.  **Separation of Concerns**: Read operations (API server) are isolated from
    write operations (backup/restore processes)

### Idempotency

The ACL automation is idempotent - if ACLs are already enabled or the user
already exists, the startup process will detect this and continue without
error. This allows for safe server restarts and upgrades.

### Troubleshooting ACLs

If you encounter ACL-related issues, check the Klio server logs:

```bash
kubectl logs my-server-klio-0 -n default -c base
```

Look for log entries related to ACL enablement:

-   `"ACLs enabled"`: ACLs were successfully enabled
-   `"ACLs already enabled"`: ACLs were previously enabled (normal on restart)
-   `"User snapshot_reader added to ACLs"`: Read-only user was successfully configured
-   `"failed to execute ACLs enablement"`: An error occurred during ACL setup

!!!note

ACL configuration happens during server startup, before the Kopia server process
begins accepting connections. Any ACL errors will appear early in the container
logs.
!!!
