-   Improvements are made to the UI and the data migration assessment report. The improvements repair a merge/split issue reported in the PDF report format.

**Repair Handler**

*Updated Repair Handlers*

The following repair handlers have been updated. Repair handlers convert Oracle syntax to Postgres-compatible syntax without manual intervention.

-   **ERH 1001 - REGEXP\_LIKE\_SYNTAX\_ERROR**

    With this update, the repair handler fixes PL/SQL objects along with storage objects.

-   **ERH 2037- TIMESTAMP\_WITH\_LOCAL\_TIMEZONE\_DATATYPE**

    Previously, the repair handler only fixed the TABLE object; now, the fix is applied to all objects.
