title: Decoding worker
description: Decoding worker in PGD reduces CPU overhead and increases replication throughput by enabling a optimized decoding worker process.
---

PGD provides an option to enable a decoding worker process that performs
decoding once, no matter how many nodes are sent data. This option introduces a
new process, the WAL decoder, on each PGD node. One WAL sender process still
exists for each connection, but these processes now just perform the task of
sending and receiving data. Taken together, these changes reduce the CPU
overhead of larger PGD groups and also allow higher replication throughput
since the WAL sender process now spends more time on communication.

## Enabling

`enable_wal_decoder` is an option for each PGD group, which is currently
disabled by default. You can use [`bdr.alter_node_group_option()`](reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_option) to enable or
disable the decoding worker for a PGD group.

When the decoding worker is enabled, PGD stores logical change record (LCR)
files to allow buffering of changes between decoding and when all
subscribing nodes received data. LCR files are stored under the
`pg_logical` directory in each local node's data directory. The number and
size of the LCR files varies as replication lag increases, so this process also
needs monitoring. The LCRs that aren't required by any of the PGD nodes are cleaned
periodically. The interval between two consecutive cleanups is controlled by
[`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval), which defaults to 3 minutes. The cleanup is
disabled when [`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval) is 0.

## Disabling

When disabled, logical decoding is performed by the WAL sender process for each
node subscribing to each node. In this case, no LCR files are written.

Even though the decoding worker is enabled for a PGD group, following
GUCs control the production and use of LCR per node. By default
these are `false`. For production and use of LCRs, enable the
decoding worker for the PGD group and set these GUCs to `true` on each of the nodes in the PGD group.

-   [`bdr.enable_wal_decoder`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrenable_wal_decoder) &mdash; When `false`, all WAL
    senders using LCRs restart to use WAL directly. When `true`
    along with the PGD group config, a decoding worker process is
    started to produce LCR and WAL senders that use LCR.
-   [`bdr.receive_lcr`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrreceive_lcr) &mdash; When `true` on the subscribing node, it requests WAL
    sender on the publisher node to use LCRs if available.


!!! Note Notes
As of now, a decoding worker decodes changes corresponding to the node where it's
running. A logical standby is sent changes from all the nodes in the PGD group
through a single source. Hence a WAL sender serving a logical standby currently can't
use LCRs.

A subscriber-only node receives changes from respective nodes directly. Hence
a WAL sender serving a subscriber-only node can use LCRs.

Even though LCRs are produced, the corresponding WALs are still retained similar
to the case when a decoding worker isn't enabled. In the future, it might be possible
to remove WAL corresponding the LCRs, if they aren't otherwise required.

## LCR file names

For reference, the first 24 characters of an LCR file name are similar to those in a WAL file name. 
The first 8 characters of the name are currently all '0'.
In the future, they're expected to represent the TimeLineId similar to the first 8 characters of a WAL segment file name. 
The following sequence of 16 characters of the name is similar to the WAL segment number, which is used to track LCR changes against the WAL stream.

However, logical changes are reordered according to the commit order of the transactions they belong to.
Hence their placement in the LCR segments doesn't match the placement of corresponding WAL in the WAL segments.

The set of the last 16 characters represents the subsegment number in an LCR segment. 
Each LCR file corresponds to a subsegment. 
LCR files are binary and variable sized. 
You can control the maximum size of an LCR file by adjusting `bdr.max_lcr_segment_file_size`, which defaults to 1 GB.

### Using with transaction streaming

It's possible to enable [transaction streaming](transaction-streaming) and the decoding worker at the same time. Transaction streaming means that the WAL sender can send a partial transaction before it commits, reducing replication lag. The WAL decoder now supports the decoding of partial transactions, so the decoding worker can decode the partial transaction and store it in an LCR file. The LCR file is then used to apply the transaction on the subscriber node. This in turn reduces CPU usage, by reducing the lag, and reduces disk space usages, since ".spill" files are not generated.

The WAL decoder always streams the transactions to LCRs but based on downstream request the WAL sender either stream transaction or just mimics a normal `BEGIN..COMMIT` scenario.

To support this feature, the system creates additional streaming files. These files have names in that begin with  `STR_TXN_<file-name-format>` and `CAS_TXN_<file-name-format>` and each streamed transaction creates their own pair.

To enable transaction streaming with the WAL decoder, set the PGD group's `bdr.streaming_mode` set to ‘default’ using [`bdr.alter_node_group_option`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_node_group_option).
