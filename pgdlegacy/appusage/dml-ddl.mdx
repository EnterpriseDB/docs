navTitle: DML and DDL replication

The two major classes of SQL statement are DML and DDL. 

* DML is the data modification language and is concerned with the SQL statements that modify the data stored in tables. It includes UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT. 

* DDL is the data definition language and is concerned with the SQL statements that modify how the data is stored. It includes CREATE, ALTER, and DROP.

PGD handles each class differently.

## DML replication

PGD doesn't replicate the DML statement. It replicates the changes caused by the
DML statement. For example, an UPDATE that changed two rows replicates two
changes, whereas a DELETE that didn't remove any rows doesn't replicate
anything. This means that the results of executing volatile statements are
replicated, ensuring there's no divergence between nodes as might occur with
statement-based replication.

## DDL replication

DDL replication works differently from DML. For DDL, PGD replicates the statement,
which then executes on all nodes. So a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` might not
replicate anything on the local node, but the statement is still sent to other
nodes for execution if DDL replication is enabled. For details, see
[DDL replication](../ddl).

PGD works to ensure that intermixed DML and DDL statements work correctly, even
in the same transaction.

## Nonreplicated statements

Outside of those two classes are SQL commands that PGD, by design, doesn't
replicate. None of the following user commands are replicated by PGD, so their
effects occur on the local/origin node only:

-   Cursor operations (DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH)
-   Execution commands (DO, CALL, PREPARE, EXECUTE, EXPLAIN)
-   Session management (DEALLOCATE, DISCARD, LOAD)
-   Parameter commands (SET, SHOW)
-   Constraint manipulation (SET CONSTRAINTS)
-   Locking commands (LOCK)
-   Table maintenance commands (VACUUM, ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX)
-   Async operations (NOTIFY, LISTEN, UNLISTEN)

Since the `NOTIFY` SQL command and the `pg_notify()` functions aren't
replicated, notifications aren't reliable in case of failover. This means that
notifications can easily be lost at failover if a transaction is committed just
when the server crashes. Applications running `LISTEN` might miss notifications
in case of failover.

This is true in standard PostgreSQL replication, and PGD doesn't yet improve on
this. 

CAMO and Eager Replication options don't allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the
`pg_notify()` function.
