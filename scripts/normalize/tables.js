// purpose:
// GFM tables require pipe characters in cells to be escaped EVEN IF WITHIN INLINE CODE
// Ref: https://github.github.com/gfm/#example-200
// The juicer scripts did not do this correctly; this resulted in tables with implicit columns,
// which the renderer would silently drop. Round-tripping through the parser -> stringifier would
// retain the columns, but now the table would look odd with cell contents split across columns and
// headers not matching up.
// Attempt to mitigate this by escaping pipe characters correctly.
// This must be run on juiced content BEFORE the markdown normalizer.
// It should do no harm if run twice.

    // in the layout of the table itself: there will be a header-body separator of the form,
    // |-------------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|
    // (where each run of dashes separated by pipes is EXACTLY the width of a column)
    // To make this a bit more effective, I allow column widths to vary from the header by *up to* 10%
    // Rows matching this layout that have pipes *within* the cells will have those pipes escaped.
    // ...
    // BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!
    // GFM doesn't support merged cells in tables, or any block-level formatting in cells...
    // ...it *will* allow you to insert a newline via a <br> tag however.
    // Whatever pandoc was targetting thinks you can do this with extra pipe characters, as follows:
    //  `| |` at the start of a table cell introduces a multiline cell; within that cell, further
    //  pipe characters indicate paragraph breaks.
    // Gatsby doesn't recognize this at all. So we gotta fix that up too, with strategic replacement
    // of that format with <br> tags.
    // ONE MORE FLY in the ointment here: per the GFM spec, \| should be de-escaped on render,
    // *even within inline code* - but our current renderer does not do this.
    // For now, I'm not trying to work around that; we need to update our renderer, and getting
    // a clean round-trip through the parser is a first step in that process.
    // rebuilding a car while going 70 down the interestate or something.
