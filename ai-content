-title: GPUs in Model Serving
-navTitle: GPUs
-description: Understand the role of GPUs in Model Serving with AI Factory, how Hybrid Manager uses them, and how to prepare GPU resources.
----
-
-GPU acceleration is essential for running modern deep learning models in production. Many Large Language Models (LLMs), embedding models, and vision models require GPUs to deliver acceptable inference performance.
-
-Model Serving in AI Factory relies on GPU-enabled Kubernetes nodes for hosting KServe InferenceServices that run these models.
-
-## Why GPUs matter for Model Serving
-
-- Many **NVIDIA NIM containers** are designed to run on GPUs, with optimized inference serving.
-- Model Serving in AI Factory supports **GPU scheduling and resource control** through Kubernetes.
-- GPU nodes enable serving models that would otherwise be too slow or expensive to run on CPUs.
-- GPU-based serving supports **AIDB Knowledge Bases** and **GenAI Builder assistants** at scale.
-
-## GPU usage in Hybrid Manager
-
-Hybrid Manager (HCP) manages the Kubernetes infrastructure where Model Serving runs. In this context:
-
-- GPU-enabled node groups (AWS EKS) or node pools (GCP GKE, RHOS) must be provisioned.
-- These nodes must be labeled and tainted to allow **KServe model pods** to schedule properly.
-- The NVIDIA Kubernetes device plugin must be installed to expose GPU resources to Kubernetes.
-- Kubernetes secrets must be created to store **NVIDIA API keys** required by NIM models.
-
-## Actions you can take
-
-To enable GPU-based Model Serving:
-
-1. Provision GPU node groups in your HCP Kubernetes cluster.
-2. Label and taint GPU nodes correctly.
-3. Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet.
-4. Create a Kubernetes secret with your NVIDIA API key.
-5. Deploy ClusterServingRuntime and InferenceService manifests targeting GPU nodes.

-title: Understanding and Managing Assistants in Gen AI Builder
-description: Understand what Assistants are in Gen AI Builder, why they matter, and how they power AI-driven interactions and applications.
----
-
-## What are Assistants
-
-**Assistants** in Gen AI Builder are AI-powered agents that perform tasks, interact with users, access knowledge, and adhere to predefined behavioral guidelines.
-They are the central building block for creating interactive, AI-driven applications within the AI Factory ecosystem.
-
-In short:
-**Assistants turn your Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, and Tools into useful, conversational AI experiences.**
-
-For a deep dive, see: [Assistants explained](../../../learn/explained/assistants-explained).
-
-## Why use Assistants
-
-Assistants enable you to:
-
-- Build **interactive AI applications** quickly and reliably.
-- **Ground AI responses** in your organization’s data (via Knowledge Bases).
-- Enforce **behavioral guidelines** through Rulesets.
-- Enable advanced **task execution** through Tools.
-- Maintain **conversational memory** to support multi-turn interactions.
-
-Assistants are the primary interface between end users and your AI Factory content + capabilities.
-
-## When to use Assistants
-
-- Whenever you want to expose AI capabilities to users — internal or external.
-- When building:
-- Support chatbots
-- Internal knowledge agents
-- Financial advisors
-- Sales assistants
-- Executive assistants
-- Compliance checkers
-- When building **multi-modal Agents** that combine:
-- Natural language conversation
-- Knowledge retrieval (RAG)
-- Behavior control
-- Task execution
-
-## How Assistants fit into Gen AI Builder
-
-Typical Assistant flow:
-
-User Input → Assistant → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
-→ Rulesets → Behavioral Guidance
-→ Tools → Action Execution (if configured)
-→ Response Generation → User Output
-
-
-
-At runtime:
-
-- The Assistant receives user input.
-- It retrieves relevant knowledge.
-- It applies behavioral Rulesets.
-- It uses Tools if needed.
-- It generates a response via its selected LLM.
-
-Assistants provide a **unified layer** over all these components.
-
-## Key features of Assistants
-
-- **LLM integration:** Powered by your choice of Large Language Models (LLMs).
-- **Knowledge Base connectivity:** Link one or more Knowledge Bases for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
-- **Ruleset application:** Enforce behavioral guidelines and tone.
-- **Tool usage:** (If configured) enable Assistants to perform external actions.
-- **Conversation management:** Maintain memory across interactions.
-- **Customization:** Tailor Assistant behavior, knowledge access, and generation parameters.
-
-## Getting started
-
-See [Create an Assistant](../../../how-to/gen-ai/create-assistant) for a full step-by-step guide.
-
-Typical workflow:
-
-1. Create an Assistant.
-2. Select LLM model.
-3. Add Knowledge Bases.
-4. Add Rulesets.
-5. Optionally configure Tools and Memory.
-6. Test and deploy the Assistant.

-title: Working with Rulesets in Gen AI Builder
-description: Understand what Rulesets are in Gen AI Builder, why they matter, and how they guide the behavior of Assistants and Structures.
----
-
-## What are Rulesets
-
-**Rulesets** in Gen AI Builder are collections of natural language instructions that guide the behavior of your Assistants and Structures.
-They help ensure responses are aligned with your specific instructions and organizational guidelines.
-
-Rulesets serve as a **layer of explicit control** over how your AI behaves — complementing the knowledge it retrieves from Knowledge Bases.
-
-In short:
-**Rulesets tell your Assistants *how* to behave, not just *what* to retrieve.**
-
-For a deep dive, see: [Rulesets explained](../../../learn/explained/rulesets-explained).
-
-## Why use Rulesets
-
-- **Guide behavior:** Ensure Assistants respond in ways that match your tone, style, and policies.
-- **Enforce constraints:** Prohibit certain types of content or behaviors (e.g., avoid legal advice, don’t mention competitors).
-- **Support multiple personas:** Define distinct behavioral patterns for different Assistants.
-- **Complement RAG pipelines:** Combine retrieved knowledge with consistent behavior.
-
-Rulesets are particularly powerful when combined with:
-
-- Knowledge Bases (what content to retrieve)
-- Structures (how to process tasks)
-- Tools (how to interact with external systems)
-
-## When to use Rulesets
-
-- When building Assistants that interact with end users.
-- When defining behavior for internal Agents and Pipelines.
-- Whenever you want to ensure **consistent tone, style, or compliance** across AI applications.
-
-**Examples:**
-
-- Customer support Assistants using polite and professional tone.
-- Internal policy chatbots with strict legal disclaimers.
-- Marketing copy Assistants that reflect brand guidelines.
-
-## How Rulesets fit into Gen AI Builder
-
-The typical workflow is:
-
-```Create Ruleset → Add Rules → Create Assistant → Assign Ruleset to Assistant```
-
-
-At runtime:
-
-- The assigned Ruleset is applied to every message processed by the Assistant.
-- The Assistant uses these Rules in combination with retrieved content and its base LLM.
-
-## Components of a Ruleset
-
-- **Name** — Required, unique name.
-- **Description** — Optional description.

-
-**Best practice:**
-Use a dedicated bucket or container **only for Gen AI Builder / Griptape**.
-
-## When to configure the Data Lake
-
-- When setting up a new Griptape deployment.
-- When connecting an external storage backend to Gen AI Builder.
-- Before adding Data Sources or creating Knowledge Bases.
-
-**Important:**
-The Data Lake must be configured **before using Libraries or Knowledge Bases**.
-
-## How does the Data Lake fit into the content pipeline
-
-The Data Lake supports the entire AI Factory pipeline:
-
-Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications
-
-
-The Data Lake is the persistent storage backend that powers:
-
-- Data Sources of type **Data Lake**
-- Content staging during Library and Knowledge Base creation
-- Storage for Griptape Structures and Tools
-
-## Getting started
-
-To configure the Data Lake:
-
-- Provision an object storage bucket (S3-compatible or GCS).

-title: Managing Data with Libraries in Gen AI Builder
-description: Understand what Libraries are in Gen AI Builder, why they matter, and how they power AI applications through Data Sources, Knowledge Bases, and Retrievers.
----
-
-## What are Libraries
-
-Libraries are a fundamental component of Gen AI Builder.
-They enable you to connect, organize, and prepare your data for use in AI-powered applications.
-
-Libraries serve as the **primary mechanism for managing knowledge sources** that your Griptape Structures — including Agents, Pipelines, and Assistants — leverage for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks.
-
-In short:
-**Libraries are the curated, organized collections of information your AI can "know" and retrieve.**
-
-## Why use Libraries
-
-Libraries allow you to:
-
-- **Centralize data** for AI: Aggregate diverse data sources into unified, accessible knowledge pools.
-- **Power Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Provide contextual data to AI structures for accurate, grounded responses.
-- **Fuel Assistants and other Structures:** Make relevant content queryable and available to Griptape-based Agents and Pipelines.
-- **Simplify data management:** Manage the full data lifecycle — connection, processing, indexing — through an intuitive UI.
-- **Support Knowledge Bases:** Libraries feed content into the Knowledge Bases that your AI Assistants ultimately query.
-
-## How Libraries fit into Gen AI Builder
-
-The content pipeline in Gen AI Builder looks like this:
-
-Data Sources → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications
-
-
-- **Data Sources:** Raw content (web pages, documents, databases, cloud storage, APIs)
-- **Libraries:** Organize and index content from Data Sources
-- **Knowledge Bases:** Searchable layer built from Libraries
-- **Retrievers:** Define how Assistants query Knowledge Bases
-- **Assistants:** Use retrieved content to generate grounded AI responses
-
-For background on key concepts, see:

-title: Working with Retrievers in Gen AI Builder
-description: Understand what Retrievers are, when and why to use them, and how they power AI Assistants in Gen AI Builder.
----
-
-## What is a Retriever
-
-A **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder is a specialized **Griptape Structure** that defines how your AI Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases.
-Retrievers enable precise, customizable information retrieval — the core of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows.
-
-At query time, your Assistant uses its configured Retriever(s) to:
-
-- Search one or more Knowledge Bases
-- Select the most relevant results ("chunks") based on semantic similarity and other filters
-- Feed that context into the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an informed response
-
-**In short:**
-A Retriever connects user queries → Knowledge Base content → AI answers.
-
----
-
-For a deep dive, see [Retrievers explained](../../../learn/explained/retrievers-explained).
-For step-by-step configuration, see [Create a Retriever](../../../how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever).
-
----
-
-## Why use Retrievers
-
-- **Ground AI responses:** Retrievers ensure that Assistants provide factually grounded answers based on your organization’s Knowledge Bases.
-- **Support explainability:** Retrieved content can be referenced in the Assistant’s responses, enabling transparent and auditable AI.
-- **Control search behavior:** You can configure which Knowledge Bases are queried, control token limits, and supply advanced metadata.
-- **Enable multi-source RAG:** Retrievers can target multiple Knowledge Bases simultaneously — useful for complex Assistants with broad knowledge scope.
-
-## When to use Retrievers
-
-- Whenever you are building an AI Assistant that needs to answer questions based on internal content.
-- Whenever your content is stored in **Knowledge Bases** and you want dynamic, query-time retrieval.
-- When you want your AI application to support **semantic search** and not rely solely on the LLM’s internal training.
-
-**Examples:**
-
-- Support chatbots answering questions from product documentation
-- Financial advisors surfacing policies and legal disclaimers on demand
-- Sales tools providing quick access to internal pricing documents and competitive intelligence
-
-## How do Retrievers work
-
-At runtime, the process is:
-
-1. User asks a question.
-2. Assistant forwards the query to its assigned Retriever(s).
-3. Retriever runs semantic + optional structured search across configured Knowledge Bases.
-4. Retriever returns the most relevant results.
-5. Assistant passes this context to the LLM.
-6. LLM generates a response incorporating the retrieved information.
-
-**Under the hood:**
-A Retriever is implemented as a Griptape Structure, giving you flexibility in how it performs retrieval.
-
-See [Griptape concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts) for more on Structures.
-
-## Key components of a Retriever
-
-- **Knowledge Bases targeted:** Determines the scope of retrieval.
-- **Max Tokens:** Controls how much content is retrieved per query.
-- **Metadata:** Optional structured data for advanced configuration or tagging.
-- **Associated Assistants:** Controls which Assistants can use this Retriever.
-
-## Getting started
-
-### Pre-requisites
-
-- One or more **Knowledge Bases** created and populated in Gen AI Builder.
-
-### First steps
-
-- Create a Retriever and configure it to target your Knowledge Bases.
-- Associate the Retriever with an AI Assistant.
-- Test the Assistant to verify that retrieved content is correctly influencing responses.
-
-See [Create a Retriever](../../../how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever) for the full step-by-step guide.

-title: Assistants explained
-description: Understand the role of Assistants in Gen AI Builder and how they power AI-driven conversational applications.
----
-
-## What is an Assistant
-
-An **Assistant** in Gen AI Builder is an AI-powered agent designed to interact with users, perform tasks, access knowledge, and follow predefined behavioral guidelines.
-
-Assistants unify:
-
-- **Natural language interaction** via LLMs
-- **Knowledge retrieval** via Knowledge Bases and Retrievers
-- **Behavior control** via Rulesets
-- **Task execution** via Tools
-- **Conversation memory** to maintain context
-
-In short:
-**Assistants turn AI Factory components into interactive, useful applications.**
-
-Assistants are the primary **deployment target** for most conversational and task-based AI use cases in Gen AI Builder.
-
-## Why use Assistants
-
-- To build **AI-driven user experiences** — chatbots, agents, copilots.
-- To combine **retrieved knowledge** with **controlled behavior**.
-- To enable **multi-step reasoning** and **task execution**.
-- To enforce **compliance**, **brand tone**, and **organizational policies**.
-- To provide **consistent memory and context** across conversations.
-
-Without Assistants, your AI Factory content (Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, Tools) would remain static — Assistants activate these components.
-
-## How Assistants work
-
-At runtime:
-
-1. The user submits input (text or other supported input).
-2. The Assistant:
-- Applies its assigned **Rulesets**.
-- Retrieves relevant content from **Knowledge Bases** (via its Retriever).
-- Applies **conversation memory**.
-- Executes **Tools** if needed.
-- Generates a response using its assigned **LLM**.
-
-3. The response is returned to the user.
-
-Assistant architecture:
-
-```User Input → Rulesets → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
-→ Tools → Action Execution
-→ Memory → Context Maintenance
-→ LLM → Response → User Output
-```
-
-
-
-## Core components of an Assistant
-
-### LLM
-
-- The Large Language Model that powers language understanding and generation.
-- Example choices:
-- GPT-4
-- Claude 3 Sonnet
-- Gemini Pro
-- Custom models via KServe
-
-### Knowledge Bases + Retriever
-
-- Retrieve relevant content using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
-- Retriever defines search behavior.
-- Knowledge Bases provide indexed, trusted content.
-
-### Rulesets
-
-- Define **how** the Assistant should behave.
-- Enforce tone, style, policy, and compliance.
-
-### Tools
-
-- Extend Assistant capabilities beyond language generation.
-- Example Tools:
-- API calls
-- Calculators
-- Internal system lookups
-- External data retrieval
-
-### Memory
-
-- Controls **conversation context**:
-- How many turns to remember
-- How to summarize or truncate history
-- Enables multi-turn coherent interactions.
-
-## When to use Assistants
-
-Use Assistants when you want to expose AI Factory capabilities through:
-
-- **Conversational interfaces** (chatbots, support bots, advisors)
-- **Internal productivity tools** (compliance checkers, knowledge agents)
-- **Copilot-style assistants** (embedded in applications)
-- **Custom API endpoints** driven by AI logic
-
-Assistants are the **primary vehicle for production AI applications** in Gen AI Builder.
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-### Single Assistant per use case
-
-- One Assistant → one primary interaction pattern.
-- Example: `PG Financial Client Support AI`.
-
-### Persona-based Assistants
-
-- Different Assistants for different **personas** or roles.
-- Example:
-- `Wealth Management Advisor`
-- `Marketing Copy Generator`
-- `Internal Policy Checker`
-
-### Shared Knowledge + Ruleset Assistants
-
-- Multiple Assistants sharing Knowledge Bases and Rulesets.
-- Useful for enforcing consistent behavior across applications.
-
-### Memory-driven Assistants
-
-- Assistants configured with advanced Memory settings.
-- Useful for:
-- Long-term user relationships.
-- Complex multi-turn workflows.
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Always combine **Knowledge Bases** + **Rulesets** → for grounded, controlled behavior.
-- Use Tools only where needed — avoid unnecessary Tool complexity.
-- Start simple → iterate on:
-- System prompt
-- Rulesets
-- Retriever tuning
-- Memory configuration
-- Test Assistants extensively before production.
-- Monitor Assistant performance and refine over time.

-title: Data Lake explained
-description: Understand the role of the Data Lake in Gen AI Builder and how it supports AI Factory content pipelines.
----
-
-## What is the Data Lake
-
-The **Data Lake** in Gen AI Builder is the foundational object storage layer that supports the entire AI Factory content pipeline.
-It provides persistent, scalable storage for:
-
-- Uploaded files from Data Sources
-- Indexed data and embeddings used in Libraries and Knowledge Bases
-- Griptape Structures and Tools
-- Temporary artifacts used in AI workflows
-
-In short:
-The Data Lake is where your AI system’s knowledge and operational data live.
-
-## Why is the Data Lake required
-
-Griptape-powered services rely on object storage to function correctly:
-
-- **Data Sources** of type Data Lake store and retrieve files here.
-- **Libraries** use the Data Lake to store processed and transformed content.
-- **Knowledge Bases** are built from content staged in the Data Lake.
-- **Structures and Tools** required by AI Agents and Pipelines are stored in the Data Lake.
-
-Without a Data Lake:
-
-- Data ingestion would fail.
-- Libraries and Knowledge Bases could not be built.
-- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines would be non-functional.
-- Structures and Tools would be unavailable to Agents and Assistants.
-
-The Data Lake is a **core dependency** of AI Factory.
-
-## How does the Data Lake fit into the content pipeline
-
-The AI Factory pipeline flows through the Data Lake:
-
-```Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications ```
-
-- **Data Sources** → Files are ingested into the Data Lake.
-- **Libraries** → Processed content is staged and indexed via the Data Lake.
-- **Knowledge Bases** → Built from the indexed content stored in the Data Lake.
-- **Retrievers / Assistants** → Retrieve content ultimately powered by Data Lake-backed pipelines.
-
-## When do you configure the Data Lake
-
-- When deploying a new Griptape / Gen AI Builder instance.
-- When connecting an external object storage backend.
-- Before adding Data Sources or creating Knowledge Bases.
-- Whenever you change your storage provider or bucket.
-
-**Important:** The Data Lake must be configured **before using Libraries or Knowledge Bases**.
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-- **Dedicated bucket:** Best practice is to provision a dedicated object storage bucket solely for Griptape and Gen AI Builder.
-- **Isolated permissions:** Object storage credentials should be scoped to this bucket only.
-- **CORS configured:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) must be set to allow UI interaction with the Data Lake.
-- **S3-compatible:** The Data Lake can be AWS S3, GCS with S3 interoperability, or any other compatible object storage service.
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Use a **dedicated bucket** per Gen AI Builder deployment.
-- Follow the **principle of least privilege** for storage credentials.
-- Configure **CORS** correctly to enable portal-based interactions.
-- Regularly review bucket permissions and audit access.
-- Monitor storage utilization and cost.

-title: Working with Retrievers in Gen AI Builder
-description: Understand what Retrievers are, when and why to use them, and how they power AI Assistants in Gen AI Builder.
----
-
-## What is a Retriever
-
-A **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder is a specialized **Griptape Structure** that defines how your AI Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases.
-Retrievers enable precise, customizable information retrieval — the core of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows.
-
-At query time, your Assistant uses its configured Retriever(s) to:
-
-- Search one or more Knowledge Bases
-- Select the most relevant results ("chunks") based on semantic similarity and other filters
-- Feed that context into the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an informed response
-
-**In short:**
-A Retriever connects user queries → Knowledge Base content → AI answers.
-
----
-
-For a deep dive, see [Retrievers explained](../../../learn/explained/retrievers-explained).
-For step-by-step configuration, see [Create a Retriever](../../../how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever).
-
----
-
-## Why use Retrievers
-
-- **Ground AI responses:** Retrievers ensure that Assistants provide factually grounded answers based on your organization’s Knowledge Bases.
-- **Support explainability:** Retrieved content can be referenced in the Assistant’s responses, enabling transparent and auditable AI.
-- **Control search behavior:** You can configure which Knowledge Bases are queried, control token limits, and supply advanced metadata.
-- **Enable multi-source RAG:** Retrievers can target multiple Knowledge Bases simultaneously — useful for complex Assistants with broad knowledge scope.
-
-## When to use Retrievers
-
-- Whenever you are building an AI Assistant that needs to answer questions based on internal content.
-- Whenever your content is stored in **Knowledge Bases** and you want dynamic, query-time retrieval.
-- When you want your AI application to support **semantic search** and not rely solely on the LLM’s internal training.
-
-**Examples:**
-
-- Support chatbots answering questions from product documentation
-- Financial advisors surfacing policies and legal disclaimers on demand
-- Sales tools providing quick access to internal pricing documents and competitive intelligence
-
-## How do Retrievers work
-
-At runtime, the process is:
-
-1. User asks a question.
-2. Assistant forwards the query to its assigned Retriever(s).
-3. Retriever runs semantic + optional structured search across configured Knowledge Bases.
-4. Retriever returns the most relevant results.
-5. Assistant passes this context to the LLM.
-6. LLM generates a response incorporating the retrieved information.
-
-**Under the hood:**
-A Retriever is implemented as a Griptape Structure, giving you flexibility in how it performs retrieval.
-
-See [Griptape concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts) for more on Structures.
-
-## Key components of a Retriever
-
-- **Knowledge Bases targeted:** Determines the scope of retrieval.
-- **Max Tokens:** Controls how much content is retrieved per query.
-- **Metadata:** Optional structured data for advanced configuration or tagging.
-- **Associated Assistants:** Controls which Assistants can use this Retriever.
-
-## Getting started
-
-### Pre-requisites
-
-- One or more **Knowledge Bases** created and populated in Gen AI Builder.
-
-### First steps
-
-- Create a Retriever and configure it to target your Knowledge Bases.
-- Associate the Retriever with an AI Assistant.
-- Test the Assistant to verify that retrieved content is correctly influencing responses.
-
-See [Create a Retriever](../../../how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever) for the full step-by-step guide.

-description: Understand the Model Library in AI Factory, how it works, and how it is powered by the Hybrid Control Plane Image and Model Library.
----
-
-# AI Factory Model Library Explained
-
-The **Model Library** in AI Factory is your central interface for discovering, managing, and deploying AI models for Model Serving within the Hybrid Control Plane (HCP) environment.
-
-It is powered by the core **Image and Model Library** of HCP.
-The Model Library presents a curated AI-focused view of model images from that broader Image Library.
-
-## How does the Model Library work?
-
-The Model Library:
-
-- Surfaces a filtered view of **AI model images** available in the Image Library.
-- Allows AI Factory users to deploy supported models to the **Model Serving (KServe)** layer.
-- Ensures all model images pass through platform-wide governance and security policies.
-
-It does not provide a separate registry or upload flow:
-
-- All model images must flow through the Image Library.
-- The Model Library reflects images that are marked as valid for AI model serving.
-
-## Architecture flow
-
-Container Registry → Image and Model Library → Model Library → Model Serving (KServe) → AI Factory Workloads
-
-| Layer | Role |
-|-------|------|
-| Container Registry | Stores model container images (ex: NVIDIA NIM) |
-| Image and Model Library | Single source of truth for all images |
-| Model Library | Curated AI-focused UI for model images |
-| Model Serving (KServe) | Runs deployed model instances |
-| AI Factory Workloads | Gen AI Builder, Knowledge Base pipelines, Assistants |
-
-## What does the Model Library provide?
-
-- Browse available model images.
-
-- View supported tags and versions.
-
-- Deploy models to Model Serving infrastructure.
-
-- Manage lifecycle of model deployments.
-
-- Understand which models are powering your AI Factory experiences:
-
-- Knowledge Bases (via AIDB).
-- Gen AI Builder (for Assistants and pipelines).
-
-## Why is it powered by Image Library?
-
-- **Governance:** All images pass through the same governance flow.
-- **Security:** Registry integration, tag selection, and auditability is unified.
-- **Consistency:** Database and AI models share the same image management system.
-- **Flexibility:** You can add your own model images (via Image Library path).
-
-→ For a deeper understanding, see: [Image and Model Library Explained](../../../../hybrid-manager/learn/explained/model-image-library)
-
-## Supported model types
-
-In current AI Factory versions:
-
-| Model Type | Example Image |
-|------------|---------------|
-| Text Completion | llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b |
-| Text Embedding | arctic-embed-l |
-| Image Embedding | nvclip |
-| OCR | paddleocr |
-| Text Reranker | llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2 |
-
-Future versions will expand supported model types and custom model support.
-
-## Model Serving integration
-
-Models deployed from the Model Library are served via **KServe**.
-
-The Model Library provides a guided workflow to deploy models:
-
-1. Select a model image and tag.
-2. Configure model runtime settings (replicas, resources, etc.).
-3. Deploy to KServe → creates an InferenceService in the HCP Kubernetes environment.
-4. The model is now available for:
- - AIDB Knowledge Base ingestion.
- - Gen AI Builder usage.
- - Other AI Factory capabilities.
-
-## Summary
-
-- The Model Library is your entry point for managing AI models in AI Factory.
-- It is powered by the core Image and Model Library of Hybrid Control Plane.
-- All model images pass through this unified governance flow.
-- Model Serving uses these images via KServe to power your AI workloads.

----
-
-# KServe Concepts: Kubernetes-Native Model Serving
-
-Use this guide to understand the core concepts of KServe, a standard for serverless inferencing on Kubernetes. Understanding these concepts helps you deploy, manage, and scale machine learning models within AI Factory.
-
-## What is KServe?
-
-KServe is an open-source, Kubernetes-native platform that provides a standardized, scalable, and simplified way to deploy and manage machine learning models in production. It builds on Kubernetes, Knative (optional, for serverless scaling), and Istio (optional, for advanced traffic management).
-
-## Purpose in model serving
-
-KServe simplifies the process of taking trained machine learning models and making them available as reliable, scalable inference services. It provides a consistent deployment experience across different model frameworks.
-
-AI Factory uses KServe as the model serving engine for Model Serving, enabling scalable, GPU-accelerated model inferencing on Kubernetes.
-
-## Core architectural principles
-
-### Standardization
-
-KServe defines a standard InferenceService Custom Resource Definition (CRD), providing a consistent interface for deploying models.
-
-### Scalability
-
-KServe leverages Kubernetes autoscaling and optionally Knative for serverless scaling. Models scale automatically based on demand.
-
-### Serverless inferencing
-
-KServe can scale models to zero when idle and back up when needed (with Knative integration). This optimizes resource usage.
-
-### Pluggable and extensible
-
-KServe supports a wide range of model servers and allows for adding pre-processing and post-processing steps through Transformers, and model explainability through Explainers.
-
-## Key components and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)
-
-### InferenceService
-
-The primary CRD for deploying a model. It includes:
-
-- **Predictor**: The core model serving component.
-- **Transformer** (optional): Pre-processing or post-processing service.
-- **Explainer** (optional): Generates model explanations.
-
-### Predictor
-
-Runs the model server and handles inference requests. It specifies:
-
-- Model server to use (e.g., NVIDIA Triton, MLServer).
-- Model location (e.g., S3, GCS, container image).
-- Resource allocations (CPU, memory, GPU).
-- Autoscaling parameters.
-
-### Transformer (optional)
-
-Handles input transformations before inference and output transformations after inference.
-
-### Explainer (optional)
-
-Provides explanations of model predictions using explainability tools.
-
-### ServingRuntime / ClusterServingRuntime
-
-Define templates for model server pods:
-
-- **ServingRuntime**: Namespace-scoped.
-- **ClusterServingRuntime**: Cluster-scoped, reusable across namespaces.
-
-They define the container image, environment variables, resource limits, and supported model formats.
-
-### Model server
-
-The software that loads the model and exposes the inference endpoint (e.g., NVIDIA Triton, TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving).
-
-## How KServe works
-
-1. You apply an InferenceService manifest to the Kubernetes cluster.
-2. The KServe controller creates the necessary Kubernetes resources:
-- Pods, Services, and autoscaling resources.
-3. The model server pod loads the model and serves inference requests.
-4. A client sends inference requests to the service URL.
-5. Requests optionally pass through a Transformer and/or Explainer before returning results.
-
-## Key features and capabilities
-
-- **Multi-framework support**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, ONNX, TensorRT, and more.
-- **GPU acceleration**: Native support for NVIDIA GPUs and Kubernetes accelerators.
-- **Autoscaling**: Including scale-to-zero with Knative.
-- **Standard inference protocols**: V2 Inference Protocol (gRPC/HTTP).
-- **Canary rollouts**: Traffic shifting for safe model updates.
-- **Observability**:
-- Prometheus metrics.
-- Logging via Kubernetes.
-- Integration with tracing systems.
-- **Batching**: Improves throughput with server-side batching.
-- **Model explainability**: Supports various explainability tools.
-
-## Role in AI Factory
-
-In AI Factory:
-
-- KServe serves as the core model serving layer.
-- AI Factory simplifies KServe deployment and management.
-- The HCP Model Library integrates with KServe for model discovery and deployment.
-- GPU resource management is integrated with KServe deployments.
-- KServe services power Gen AI Builder agents and AIDB Knowledge Bases.
-- Centralized observability is provided through AI Factory observability tooling.

-title: Retrievers explained
-description: Understand the role of Retrievers in Gen AI Builder and how they power Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search.
----
-
-## What is a Retriever
-
-A **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder is a specialized **Griptape Structure** that defines how an AI Assistant retrieves relevant information from one or more Knowledge Bases at query time.
-
-Retrievers form the core of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines:
-
-- They take the user’s question or Assistant task as input.
-- They run semantic and optional structured search across configured Knowledge Bases.
-- They return the most relevant "chunks" or documents.
-- The Assistant passes this retrieved content to the Large Language Model (LLM) as part of its input context.
-
-**In short:**
-Retrievers connect your Assistant to your Knowledge Bases — grounding the AI in your organization’s content.
-
-## Why use Retrievers
-
-- **Ground AI responses:** Prevent hallucination by anchoring responses in trusted, current content.
-- **Enable explainability:** Retrieved content can be shown or cited in AI responses.
-- **Power multi-KB search:** Assistants can target multiple Knowledge Bases via a single Retriever.
-- **Customize retrieval behavior:** Max Tokens, metadata, and Griptape Structure logic enable fine-tuning.
-
-Without Retrievers, Assistants can only rely on their base model knowledge — which is static and cannot reflect your organization's current content.
-
-## How do Retrievers work
-
-Under the hood:
-
-1. User asks a question.
-2. Assistant sends this query to its assigned Retriever(s).
-3. Retriever (Griptape Structure) runs:
-- **Vector search** on unstructured content (using embeddings).
-- **Structured filtering** (if Hybrid KB is used and filters are specified).
-- **Ranking and selection** of relevant results.
-4. Retriever returns results to the Assistant:
-- Content is formatted as context for the LLM.
-- Optionally, references and metadata can be passed along.
-5. Assistant generates its response using the retrieved content.
-
-This entire flow happens **at query time** — ensuring responses reflect the most current content in your Knowledge Bases.
-
-## The role of Griptape Structures
-
-Retrievers are implemented as **Griptape Structures** — making them highly customizable.
-
-The core structure typically defines:
-
-- Query preprocessing logic (if needed)
-- Search logic (vector search + filters)
-- Result post-processing and formatting
-- Optional metadata injection
-
-This architecture allows organizations to:
-
-- Implement custom ranking strategies.
-- Apply domain-specific filters.
-- Enrich retrieved results with contextual tags.
-
-See [Structures explained](structures) for more on Griptape Structures.
-
-## Tuning and configuration points
-
-### Knowledge Bases selection
-
-- Select one or more Knowledge Bases to target.
-- A Retriever can search across **multiple KBs** — useful for broad Assistants.
-
-### Max Tokens
-
-- Controls the total size of content passed to the LLM.
-- Tuning guidance:
-- Too low → insufficient context for high-quality answers.
-- Too high → risk of LLM truncating the prompt or blowing past token limits.
-- Typical values: 1000–3000 depending on use case and LLM in use.
-
-### Metadata
-
-- Optional JSON object.
-- Use for:
-- Internal tracking and versioning
-- Configuring advanced search behavior (if supported by your Retriever Structure)
-- Passing hints to Assistants
-
-### Filters (Hybrid KB)
-
-- If targeting a Hybrid Knowledge Base, structured filters can be applied (e.g., region, product, price).
-- The Retriever Structure must support applying these filters.
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-### Single-KB Retriever
-
-- Simple pattern — target one Knowledge Base.
-- Example: `HR Policy Retriever` → queries `HR Policy KB`.
-
-### Multi-KB Retriever
-
-- Targets multiple Knowledge Bases.
-- Useful when an Assistant covers broad domains.
-- Example: `Support Assistant Retriever` → queries `Product Docs KB`, `Pricing Policies KB`, `Support FAQs KB`.
-
-### Hybrid KB Retriever
-
-- Targets Hybrid Knowledge Base.
-- Supports structured filtering + semantic search.
-- Example: `Product Catalog Retriever` → allows user to search `Product Catalog Hybrid KB` with filters for `Category`, `Price`, etc.
-
-### Cross-domain Retriever
-
-- Designed for Assistants that switch "personas" or tasks.
-- Can be implemented as:
-- Single Retriever with dynamic KB selection
-- Multiple Retrievers assigned per task or Assistant persona
-
-## Common tuning scenarios
-
-| Goal                                 | Tuning action                  |
-|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
-| Limit long irrelevant documents      | Tune Max Tokens downward      |
-| Retrieve rich multi-paragraph context| Tune Max Tokens upward        |
-| Filter by structured fields          | Use Hybrid KB with filters    |
-| Improve ranking quality              | Customize Griptape Structure |
-| Enable multi-source RAG              | Target multiple Knowledge Bases |

-title: Rulesets explained
-description: Understand the role of Rulesets in Gen AI Builder and how they guide the behavior of Assistants and Structures.
----
-
-## What is a Ruleset
-
-A **Ruleset** in Gen AI Builder is a collection of natural language Rules that guide the behavior of Assistants and Structures.
-Rulesets define *how* an AI should behave when generating responses — complementing the *what* that comes from Knowledge Bases and Retrievers.
-
-Rulesets are written in natural language and provide clear instructions such as:
-
-- Maintain a polite and professional tone.
-- Do not mention competitors.
-- Always include legal disclaimers when discussing financial advice.
-
-In short:
-**Rulesets shape the "voice" and compliance of your AI — ensuring consistent, brand-aligned, and policy-compliant behavior.**
-
-## Why use Rulesets
-
-- **Control tone and style:** Ensure Assistants match your organizational voice.
-- **Enforce compliance:** Apply mandatory legal, ethical, or policy-driven behavior.
-- **Support multiple personas:** Define distinct behavioral patterns for different Assistants.
-- **Complement RAG:** Provide behavioral context that works alongside retrieved knowledge.
-
-Without Rulesets, Assistants rely solely on base model behavior — which may not align with your organizational requirements.
-
-## How Rulesets work
-
-At runtime, the process is:
-
-1. The user submits a query to the Assistant.
-2. The Assistant forwards the query to its Retriever (if configured) and gathers relevant content.
-3. The Assistant also applies its assigned **Ruleset**, which is passed to the underlying Griptape Structure that governs response generation.
-4. The LLM receives:
-- The user query
-- Retrieved content (context)
-- The **Ruleset** as behavioral instructions
-5. The LLM generates a response **that adheres to the Ruleset** and is informed by the retrieved content.
-
-Rulesets are implemented internally as **Griptape Structures**:
-
-- Each Rule is a natural language instruction.
-- The Ruleset defines which Rules apply to an Assistant.
-- The Griptape runtime injects Ruleset instructions into the system prompt or preamble for the LLM.
-
-See [Structures explained](structures) for more on Griptape Structures.
-
-## When to use Rulesets
-
-- **Always** when deploying Assistants in production.
-- Whenever tone, style, or compliance matter.
-- When building Assistants for different audiences:
-- Support Agents
-- Internal Knowledge Agents
-- Sales and Marketing Assistants
-- Executive Assistants
-- When using different **personas** or Assistant "voices."
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-### Single Ruleset → One Assistant
-
-- Simple pattern.
-- One Ruleset defines the tone and policy for one Assistant.
-- Example: `Polite Support Tone` Ruleset → assigned to `Customer Support Assistant`.
-
-### Shared Ruleset → Multiple Assistants
-
-- One Ruleset reused across multiple Assistants.
-- Useful for enforcing organization-wide policies (e.g., legal disclaimers).
-- Example: `Financial Advice Disclaimer` Ruleset → used by both `Wealth Management Bot` and `Internal Compliance Checker`.
-
-### Layered persona Rulesets
-
-- Use multiple Rulesets or composite Rulesets to create layered personas:
-- Global compliance Ruleset
-- Brand tone Ruleset
-- Assistant-specific Ruleset
-- Example:
-- `Brand Tone` + `Legal Compliance` + `Executive Assistant Voice`
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Write Rules in **clear, unambiguous natural language**.
-- Avoid conflicting or overlapping Rules.
-- Test Assistants with Rulesets applied — adjust as needed.
-- Use **Metadata** and **Alias** fields to support versioning and structured management.
-- Keep global / reusable Rulesets modular (do not duplicate content across many Rulesets).
-- Maintain an **audit trail** of Ruleset updates in regulated environments.

-
-Structures make your AI applications **deeply extensible and production-capable**.
-
-## How Structures work
-
-A Structure is implemented as a Griptape agent, pipeline, or workflow:
-
-- **Griptape agent** → conversational AI logic.
-- **Griptape pipeline** → multi-step data transformation.
-- **Griptape workflow** → complex orchestration across agents and tools.
-
-Structures are:
-
-- Packaged as Zip files or deployed from GitHub.
-- Configured with:
-- Structure Config file (YAML / Python)
-- Environment variables (API keys, secrets, parameters)
-- Executed:
-- On demand via the Web Console.
-- Programmatically via API.
-- As Tools called by Assistants.
-- In Data Source pipelines.
-
-## Where Structures fit in the AI Factory pipeline
-```Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants
-```
-

-
-### Structure as a Tool
-
-- Structure is published as a Tool.
-- Assistant can call Structure at runtime.
-- Example: `Product Inventory Lookup` Tool.
-
-### Structure as Data Transformer
-
-- Structure used in **Data Source pipeline**.
-- Transforms incoming data before indexing.
-- Example: `PDF Parser + Metadata Enricher`.
-
-### Structure as Custom Data Source
-
-- Structure implements a **custom Retriever** or **custom Data Source**.
-- Example: `Real-Time Pricing Retriever`.
-
-## Best practices
-

-title: Threads explained
-description: Understand the role of Threads in Gen AI Builder and how they provide conversation history, state persistence, and insights into Assistant behavior.
----
-
-## What is a Thread
-
-A **Thread** in Gen AI Builder represents a **single conversation history** — a sequence of interactions (messages) between a user and an AI Assistant.
-
-Threads allow you to:
-
-- Review entire conversations.
-- Debug and analyze Assistant behavior.
-- Persist and manage conversation context.
-- Support compliance and audit requirements.
-
-Each Thread stores:
-
-- The full message flow.
-- Tool invocations and results.
-- Memory state (if applicable).
-- System-level metadata.
-
-In short:
-**Threads are the *source of truth* for understanding what happened in an AI-powered conversation.**
-
-## Why use Threads
-
-- To **review conversation history** and verify behavior.
-- To **analyze user interaction patterns** and improve Assistants.
-- To **debug issues** reported by users.
-- To support **compliance auditing** with conversation logs.
-- To track and manage **conversation memory**.
-- To enable **stateful experiences** that span multiple sessions.
-
-Threads are essential for **production AI systems** where quality, traceability, and state persistence are required.
-
-## How Threads work
-
-At runtime:
-
-1. User initiates a conversation → new **Thread** is created.
-2. Each user input and Assistant response is added to the Thread.
-3. If **Tools** are invoked, their results are recorded in the Thread.
-4. If **memory** is enabled, context state is updated in the Thread.
-5. The Thread persists across turns → enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.
-
-Data flow:
-
-```User Input → Assistant → LLM → Response
-→ Message added to Thread → Memory updated → Tool results recorded
-→ Next user input → repeat
-```
-
-Every Thread captures:
-
-- Message sequence (user → Assistant → user ...).
-- Tool calls and responses.
-- Memory state across turns.
-- Timestamps and metadata.
-
-## When to use Threads
-
-Use Threads when you need to:
-
-- Perform **QA** on Assistant behavior.
-- Debug reported issues.
-- Analyze conversation flows to improve Assistants.
-- Verify that **Rulesets** and **Knowledge Bases** are applied correctly.
-- Support **compliance** with auditable conversation records.
-- Implement stateful Assistants with long-term memory.
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-### Conversation QA
-
-- Regularly review Threads for key Assistants.
-- Spot tone issues, factual errors, Rule violations.
-
-### Debugging
-
-- Investigate specific user reports:
-- Find the Thread.
-- Trace conversation step-by-step.
-
-### Compliance auditing
-
-- Export Threads for regulated Assistants.
-- Provide conversation logs for external audits.
-
-### Conversation analytics
-
-- Analyze common user questions.
-- Identify gaps in Knowledge Bases.
-- Inform content strategy.
-
-### Stateful Assistants
-
-- Implement Assistants with memory.
-- Use Threads to maintain and review conversation state.
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Regularly **review Threads** as part of QA processes.
-- Implement **naming conventions** or metadata to make Threads easily searchable.
-- Use **Thread search and filtering** to quickly locate relevant conversations.
-- Monitor **Tool usage** inside Threads — validate Tool call success and outputs.
-- For **memory-enabled Assistants**, use Threads to monitor:
-- Context flow.
-- Summary accuracy.
-- Memory window settings.
-- For **compliance-sensitive Assistants**, implement automated export or archiving of Threads.
-- Retain Threads according to **data retention policies**:
-- Privacy requirements.
-- Audit needs.
-- Storage cost considerations.

-title: Tools explained
-description: Understand the role of Tools in Gen AI Builder and how they extend the capabilities of Assistants and Structures.
----
-
-## What is a Tool
-
-A **Tool** in Gen AI Builder is a Griptape-powered component that extends the capabilities of AI Assistants and Structures by enabling them to perform actions beyond simple text generation.
-
-Tools act as callable functions or plugins that can:
-
-- Query external systems.
-- Perform calculations.
-- Retrieve live data.
-- Interact with APIs.
-- Execute business logic.
-
-In short:
-**Tools make your AI *active*, not just reactive — enabling it to take meaningful actions.**
-
-Without Tools, Assistants and Structures are limited to generating responses based on static knowledge.
-
-## Why use Tools
-
-- To enable AI-driven applications that can **interact with external systems**.
-- To enrich conversations with **live data**.
-- To automate **business processes**.
-- To implement **organization-specific logic** as reusable components.
-- To allow LLMs to answer questions they otherwise could not — by giving them access to Tools.
-
-Tools transform Assistants from static Q&A bots into **true interactive agents**.
-
-## How Tools work
-
-Tools are implemented as **Griptape Tools** — Python classes that define one or more callable activities.
-
-At runtime:
-
-1. User submits input to an Assistant.
-2. The LLM determines that a Tool should be used.
-3. The Assistant calls the Tool, passing required parameters.
-4. The Tool executes:
-- Calls an API.
-- Performs a calculation.
-- Fetches data.
-- Runs any defined business logic.
-5. The Tool returns results to the Assistant.
-6. The Assistant incorporates the Tool result into its response.
-
-The flow:
-```User Input → Assistant → LLM decides → Tool Invocation
-→ Tool executes → Tool result → LLM generates final response → User Output
-```
-
-
-Tool configuration:
-
-- Packaged as a Zip file or deployed from GitHub.
-- Includes:
-- Griptape Tool class (Python).
-- Tool Config file.
-- Environment variables (e.g., API keys).
-
-Tools can also be used:
-
-- Within **Structures** → as components of pipelines.
-- In **Data Source pipelines** → for data transformation.
-
-## When to use Tools
-
-Use Tools when you need:
-
-- **Live data retrieval**:
-- Stock prices
-- Weather
-- Exchange rates
-- News headlines
-- **API integration**:
-- Internal databases
-- CRM systems
-- Custom applications
-- **Business logic execution**:
-- Complex calculations
-- Rule-based processing
-- **Process automation**:
-- Multi-step workflows triggered by user input
-
-If you want an Assistant to answer:
-
-*"What’s the current EUR to USD exchange rate?"*
-→ You need a Tool.
-
-If you want an Assistant to:
-
-*"Summarize all open Jira tickets for my team."*
-→ You need a Tool.
-
-## Patterns of use
-
-### API Connector Tool
-
-- Calls an external API and returns data.
-- Example: `FX Rate Tool`, `Weather Lookup Tool`.
-
-### Calculator Tool
-
-- Performs internal calculations and returns result.
-- Example: `Mortgage Calculator Tool`.
-
-### Data Fetcher Tool
-
-- Retrieves data from an internal system.
-- Example: `Customer Profile Lookup Tool`.
-
-### Data Transformer Tool
-
-- Preprocesses or transforms data.
-- Example: `Document Summarizer Tool`.
-
-### Process Automation Tool
-
-- Triggers multi-step processes or workflows.
-- Example: `Order Processing Tool`.
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Implement Tools as **modular Griptape Tools**:
-- Use @activity decorators for activities.
-- Define clear input/output schemas.
-- Write **robust error handling** — handle API failures gracefully.
-- Externalize secrets via **environment variables** — never hardcode credentials.
-- Keep Tools focused — one Tool → one purpose.
-- Use **Tool metadata and versioning** to manage lifecycle.
-- Test Tools independently before integrating with Assistants.
-- Monitor Tool usage and performance.
-- Document Tool behavior clearly for users and developers.

-title: Configure the Data Lake in Gen AI Builder
-description: How to configure the Data Lake in Gen AI Builder to support content storage and AI pipelines.
----
-
-## Who is this for
-
-Platform users setting up Gen AI Builder or Hybrid Manager with Griptape.
-This includes platform administrators, DevOps engineers, and AI builders configuring backend storage for AI Factory.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-You will configure a **Data Lake** — the object storage backend required for Griptape services to function.
-You will create and configure a storage bucket, set CORS policies, and provide required credentials.
-
-## Why configure the Data Lake
-
-- The Data Lake is used to store:
-- Uploaded files from Data Sources
-- Indexed data and embeddings
-- Griptape Structures and Tools
-- Temporary artifacts used by Griptape-powered services
-- Without a Data Lake, Libraries, Knowledge Bases, and AI Assistants will not function.
-- The Data Lake must be configured **before adding Data Sources or creating Knowledge Bases**.
-
-For background, see:
-
-- [Data Lake explained](../../../learn/explained/data-lake-explained)
-- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
-- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)
-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: Moderate (object storage + configuration)
-- **Estimated time**: 10–20 minutes
-
-## Pre-requisites
-
-- Access to an S3-compatible object storage provider:
-- AWS S3
-- Google Cloud Storage (GCS) with S3 interoperability enabled
-- Other compatible services (MinIO, Ceph, etc.)
-- Permissions to create buckets and manage CORS.
-- Ability to obtain object storage credentials.
-
-## How to configure the Data Lake
-
-### 1. Create a dedicated bucket
-
-Provision a new bucket **dedicated for Griptape / Gen AI Builder**.
-
-**Best practice:** Do not reuse a general-purpose bucket.
-
-#### AWS S3 or compatible
-
-- Create a bucket (example: `docs-temp-hcp`).
-
-#### Google Cloud Storage (GCS)
-
-- Create a bucket.
-- Enable **S3 interoperability** in GCS settings.
-- Assign required roles:
-- Storage Admin
-- Service Account Token Creator
-- Generate HMAC keys (used as Access Key ID and Secret Access Key).
-
-### 2. Configure CORS policy
-
-You must configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) to allow UI interactions with the Data Lake.
-
-#### Example CORS for S3-compatible storage
-
-```json
-[
-    {
-        "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
-        "AllowedMethods": ["PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "GET", "HEAD"],
-        "AllowedOrigins": ["https://<PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME>"],
-        "ExposeHeaders": []
-    }
-]
-```
-Example CORS for GCS
-1. Create cors-config.json:
-
-```[
-  {
-    "origin": ["https://<PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME>"],
-    "method": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
-    "responseHeader": ["*"],
-    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
-  }
-]
-```
-2. Apply policy:
-```
-gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://<your-gcs-bucket-name>
-```
-3. Obtain credentials
-You will need the following for your Griptape deployment:
-
-Bucket name
-
-S3 Endpoint URL
-
-Access Key ID
-
-Secret Access Key
-
-Region (if applicable)
-
-For GCS: Use HMAC keys as your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
-
-4. Provide credentials to deployment
-Configure your Kubernetes deployment or backend:
-
-Environment variables
-
-Configuration files / secrets
-
-Typical environment variables:
-
-
-```DATA_LAKE_BUCKET_NAME=docs-temp-hcp
-DATA_LAKE_ENDPOINT_URL=https://<your-endpoint>
-DATA_LAKE_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access-key-id>
-DATA_LAKE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret-access-key>
-DATA_LAKE_REGION=<region>  # If applicable
-```
-
-5. Verify connectivity
-In Gen AI Builder, navigate to Data Lake.
-
-You should see your configured bucket listed.
-
-You can create folders or upload test files to verify permissions.
-
-Example: docs-temp-hcp → Create Folder → Upload File
-
-Troubleshooting
-Bucket not visible in Gen AI Builder
-Verify that credentials are correct and permissions are granted.
-
-Check that CORS policy allows required methods.
-
-Uploads or UI interactions fail
-Confirm CORS settings.
-
-Verify that bucket is dedicated to Griptape — avoid conflicting bucket policies.
-
-Access denied errors
-Ensure that the Access Key ID / Secret Access Key has the required permissions:
-
-S3 or Storage Object Admin
-
-Read / write / delete permissions on the bucket

-title: Create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder
-description: How to create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder to organize content from your Libraries for AI applications.
----
-
-## Who is this for
-
-Platform users who want to create Knowledge Bases to support AI applications that deliver context-aware responses.
-Typical users include developers, AI architects, and business owners managing Knowledge Bases in production environments.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-You will create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder by selecting one or more Libraries as its content source.
-You can choose between fully managed vector stores, self-managed databases, or hybrid Knowledge Bases that combine structured and unstructured data.
-
-## Why use Knowledge Bases
-
-- Knowledge Bases provide a consistent, queryable foundation for AI applications.
-- They power semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by organizing embedded content.
-- You can manage updates to Knowledge Bases by refreshing source Libraries and re-syncing Knowledge Bases.
-- Hybrid Knowledge Bases let you combine structured metadata with rich unstructured text, supporting advanced AI use cases.
-
-For background, see:
-
-- [Knowledge Bases explained](../../../learn/explained/knowledge-bases)
-- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
-- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)
-- [Embeddings explained](../../../learn/explained/embeddings)
-- [Structures explained](../../../learn/explained/structures)
-
-To see how Knowledge Bases are used in **Hybrid Manager deployments**, visit:
-
-- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)
-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: Low to moderate (depends on Knowledge Base type selected).
-- **Estimated time**: 5–15 minutes.
-
-## How to create a Knowledge Base
-
-1. Navigate to **Knowledge Bases** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
-2. Select **Create Knowledge Base**.
-
-### Common fields
-
-- **Name**: Provide a clear, unique name. (Required.)
-Example: `Company Policy KB`
-- **Description**: Optional text to describe the Knowledge Base.
-
-### Select the type of Knowledge Base
-
-Gen AI Builder supports three Knowledge Base types:
-
-### 1. PG.AI - Fully-Managed Vector Store
-
-Use this option to create a vector-based Knowledge Base with a fully managed backend.
-
-- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries to populate the Knowledge Base.
-- Example Libraries: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`
-
-This is ideal for unstructured text content and general-purpose semantic search.
-
-#### Example
-
-- Name: `Company Policy KB`
-- Libraries selected: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`
-
-### 2. PG.AI Database - Self-Managed
-
-Use this option to connect to an existing PostgreSQL-compatible database with AI/vector extensions.
-
-- **Connection String**: Enter the full connection string for your database.
-- Example: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
-- **Password**: Enter the password for the database user.
-- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries to populate the Knowledge Base.
-
-This is suitable if you want to control your own database infrastructure, typically an HCP-managed Postgres instance with AIDB or pgvector.
-
-#### Example
-
-- Name: `Tech Docs Self-Managed KB`
-- Connection String: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/techdocs`
-- Password: `**********`
-- Library selected: `API Documentation Library`
-
-### 3. PG.AI - Hybrid Database (for Structured/Unstructured Data)
-
-Use this option when your source data is structured (CSV, Google Sheet) and you want to combine structured filters with unstructured semantic search.
-
-- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries (usually from structured sources).
-- **Structured Columns**:
-- Add one or more structured columns.
-- Provide the column name, optional description, and select data type (Text, Number, Date, Boolean).
-- **Unstructured Columns**:
-- Add one or more unstructured columns (text fields to embed for semantic search).
-- Provide the column name and optional description.
-
-This is ideal for product catalogs, customer profiles, or any hybrid data scenario.
-
-#### Example
-
-- Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
-- Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
-- Structured Columns:
-- `SKU` (Text)
-- `Price` (Number)
-- Unstructured Columns:
-- `ProductName`
-- `Features`
-
-## Finalizing creation
-
-After configuring the Knowledge Base:
-
-- Select **Create**.
-- The system will build the Knowledge Base and begin populating it from your selected Libraries.
-- You can monitor progress in the Knowledge Bases list view.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Missing Libraries
-
-- Ensure that the source Libraries you want to use have been created and are populated.
-
-### Connection errors (Self-Managed)
-
-- Verify that the database connection string and password are correct.
-- Check that your database is configured with required extensions (pgvector, AIDB) and is reachable from Gen AI Builder.
-
-### Incomplete indexing (Hybrid KB)
-
-- Check that the correct columns were selected for structured and unstructured indexing.
-- Verify column names match exactly with the source Library schema.
-
-## Example scenario
-
-You want to create a unified Knowledge Base for your product catalog.
-
-Example configuration:
-
-- Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
-- Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
-- Structured Columns:
-- `SKU` (Text)
-- `Price` (Number)
-- Unstructured Columns:
-- `ProductName`
-- `Features`

-title: Configure a Custom data source
-description: How to configure a Custom data source in Gen AI Builder using a PG.AI Structure to ingest data from proprietary systems.
----
-
-## Who is this for
-
-Platform users who need to ingest data from proprietary systems, internal databases, or APIs not supported by built-in data source types.
-Typical users include developers, system integrators, and advanced data engineers who build custom pipelines and Structures.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-You will configure a Custom data source in Gen AI Builder by selecting a pre-configured PG.AI Structure that acts as a data provider. The output of this Structure will be ingested and made available for indexing into Libraries and Knowledge Bases.
-
-## Why use a Custom data source
-
-- Internal data often resides in proprietary databases, APIs, or specialized data stores.
-- The Custom data source allows you to connect these systems by writing a PG.AI Structure that performs the data retrieval.
-- This offers maximum flexibility while ensuring the resulting content flows through Gen AI Builder’s ingestion and transformation pipeline.
-
-For background on how this content powers downstream AI use cases, see:
-
-- [Knowledge Bases overview](../../../pipeline/knowledge_base/index)
-- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)
-- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)
-
-For concepts related to Structures, see:
-
-- [Structures explained](../../../learn/explained/structures)
-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: High. You must write or have access to a PG.AI Structure that correctly implements data retrieval logic.
-- **Estimated time**: 15–60 minutes depending on Structure complexity and target system integration.
-
-## Key considerations
-
-### Structure design
-
-- The selected PG.AI Structure must be implemented and tested to act as a data source (data provider Structure).
-- The Structure should return data in a format suitable for downstream processing (typically textual).
-- The Structure should handle retries, error conditions, and paging if applicable.
-
-### Transform logic
-
-- You can optionally apply a separate "Transform your data" Structure to further refine, clean, or enrich the content before indexing.
-
-### Security and compliance
-
-- If the Structure connects to sensitive systems, ensure appropriate access controls, authentication, and logging are implemented.
-- Be mindful of privacy regulations and data handling requirements.
-
-## How to configure a Custom data source
-
-1. In the interface where you manage data sources, select **+ Add New Data Source**.
-2. Choose **Custom Data Source** from the available data source types.
-3. Configure the following fields:
-
-- **Name**: Provide a clear and unique name. Example: `Legacy CRM Connector`.
-- **Description** (optional): Add descriptive context for future reference.
-
-4. Connect to Custom Data Source:
-
-- **PG.AI Structure**: Select the pre-configured PG.AI Structure that implements your data retrieval logic.
-- Example: `InternalProductAPIReader`
-
-5. (Optional) Configure advanced options:
-
-- **Scheduled refresh**: Enable this option to automatically refresh the data on a schedule.
-- Provide a cron expression. Example: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM).
-- **Transform your data**: Enable this option to apply an additional PG.AI Structure to transform the data during ingestion.
-- Select an existing Structure from the list.
-
-6. Select **Create** to add the Custom data source.
-
-## Supported content
-
-- Determined by the output of the selected PG.AI Structure.
-- Typically textual data suitable for AI processing.
-
-## Managing and refreshing the data source
-
-Once created, the Custom data source can be viewed and managed through the Data Sources interface.
-
-Actions available:
-
-- **Edit**: Modify the data source configuration.
-- **Refresh**: Manually trigger a data ingestion job.
-- **Delete**: Remove the data source.
-
-You can also review the data job history to monitor ingestion performance and troubleshoot issues.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Structure not listed
-
-- Verify that your PG.AI Structure is correctly registered and marked as a data source (data provider Structure).
-- Ensure the Structure is accessible in your current project or environment.
-
-### Fetching errors or incomplete data
-
-- Check the Structure’s implementation for errors, authentication issues, or unexpected API changes.
-- Review the data job history for detailed error messages.
-
-## Example scenario
-
-You want to ingest product catalog data from an internal REST API into Gen AI Builder.
-
-Example configuration:
-
-- **Name**: `Product Catalog via Custom API`
-- **PG.AI Structure**: `InternalProductAPIReader`
-- **Scheduled refresh**: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM)
-- **Transform your data**: Apply a Structure that extracts and formats product descriptions.

-title: Configure a Data Lake data source
-description: How to configure a Data Lake data source in Gen AI Builder to ingest files from your platform-managed Data Lake.
----
-
-## Who is this for
-
-Platform users who want to ingest file-based content from the platform’s managed Data Lake into Gen AI Builder for use in Knowledge Bases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows.
-This is typically used by developers, data engineers, and business owners building AI applications that require internal structured or unstructured documents.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-You will configure a Data Lake data source in Gen AI Builder to ingest files from a selected Data Lake bucket and (optionally) specific asset paths. The content will then be available for indexing into Libraries and Knowledge Bases.
-
-## Why use a Data Lake data source
-
-- Many enterprise documents (PDFs, CSVs, Markdown, text files) already reside in internal Data Lake storage.
-- The Data Lake source provides a highly reliable, cost-effective way to bring this content into AI workflows.
-- Unlike public web content, Data Lake files are typically higher-trust, internal documents.
-- The Data Lake source allows for precise targeting (specific folders or files), making it efficient and scalable.
-
-For background on how this content powers downstream AI use cases, see:
-
-- [Knowledge Bases overview](../../../pipeline/knowledge_base/index)
-- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)
-- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)
-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: Low to moderate. You need familiarity with your Data Lake structure (bucket names and paths).
-- **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes if paths are known and bucket access is already configured.
-
-## Key considerations
-
-### Data relevance and quality
-
-- Ingest only trusted, high-quality files that are useful for your AI applications.
-- Well-structured files (consistent formatting, well-written text) lead to better AI results.
-
-### Scope of ingestion
-
-- Be specific about which files or folders you ingest. Use targeted paths instead of entire buckets where possible.
-- Ingesting too broad a scope (e.g., entire raw data buckets) can lead to large processing costs and irrelevant content.
-
-### Permissions and access
-
-- You must have appropriate permissions to the selected Data Lake bucket and paths.
-- If no specific asset paths are provided, all files in the selected bucket will be ingested.
-
-## How to configure a Data Lake data source
-
-1. In the interface where you manage data sources, select **+ Add New Data Source**.
-2. Choose **Data Lake** from the available data source types.
-3. Configure the following fields:
-
-- **Name**: Provide a clear and unique name. Example: `Q1 Product Specs - Data Lake`.

-
-4. Connect to Data Lake:
-
-- **Bucket**: Select the Data Lake bucket from the dropdown list.
-- **Asset Paths**:
-- Enter one or more specific paths to files or folders. Example: `manuals/pdf/current-version/`
-- Select **Add Asset Path** to add more paths.
-- If no paths are provided, the system will ingest all files in the bucket.
-
-5. (Optional) Configure advanced options:
-
-- **Scheduled refresh**: Enable this option to automatically refresh the data on a schedule.
-- Provide a cron expression. Example: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM).
-- **Transform your data**: Enable this option to apply a PG.AI Structure to transform the data during ingestion.
-- Select an existing Structure from the list.
-
-6. Select **Create** to add the Data Lake data source.
-
-## Supported file types
-
-- PDF
-- CSV
-- Markdown
-- Most text-based file types
-
-For more about how content is indexed and retrieved from these files, see [Embeddings explained](../../../learn/explained/embeddings).
-
-## Managing and refreshing the data source
-
-Once created, the Data Lake data source can be viewed and managed through the Data Sources interface.
-
-Actions available:
-
-- **Edit**: Modify the data source configuration.
-- **Refresh**: Manually trigger a data ingestion job.
-- **Delete**: Remove the data source.
-
-You can also review the data job history to monitor ingestion performance and troubleshoot issues.
-
-## Troubleshooting

-title: Best practices for Hybrid Knowledge Bases
-description: How to design Hybrid Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder using structured and unstructured columns effectively.
----
-
-## Who is this for
-
-Platform users creating Hybrid Knowledge Bases to power advanced AI applications combining structured and unstructured data.
-Typical users include developers, AI architects, data engineers, and content managers working with product catalogs, customer profiles, or mixed datasets.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-You will learn best practices for designing Hybrid Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder:
-
-- How to select structured and unstructured columns
-- How to design a schema that supports powerful AI queries
-- How to avoid common pitfalls in Hybrid Knowledge Base design
-
-## Why design Hybrid Knowledge Bases carefully
-
-- Hybrid Knowledge Bases allow you to combine **structured filters** (exact matches, ranges, facets) with **semantic search** (vector-based search).
-- A well-designed Hybrid Knowledge Base enables more accurate, flexible, and explainable AI responses.
-- Poor schema design can lead to inefficient queries, incomplete search results, or wasted processing.
-
-For background, see:
-
-- [Knowledge Bases explained](../../../learn/explained/knowledge-bases)
-- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
-- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)
-- [Embeddings explained](../../../learn/explained/embeddings)
-
-To see how Hybrid Knowledge Bases are used in **Hybrid Manager deployments**, visit:
-
-- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)
-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: Moderate — schema design requires understanding your data and use cases.
-- **Estimated time**: 15–30 minutes per Hybrid Knowledge Base.
-
-## Designing Hybrid Knowledge Bases
-
-### Understand your use case
-
-Start by understanding what types of queries you want your AI application to support.
-
-Examples:
-
-- "Show products under $500 in category 'Outdoor' and rank by relevance to search terms."
-- "Find policies for region 'EU' that mention data retention."
-
-### Selecting structured columns
-
-**Structured columns** support:
-
-- Exact match filters (e.g., `region = 'EU'`)
-- Range queries (e.g., `price BETWEEN 100 AND 500`)
-- Faceted search (e.g., list all `categories`)
-
-Best practices:
-
-- Use **short, unambiguous column names** that match your Library schema exactly.
-- Choose data types carefully:
-- `Text` for identifiers and categories (SKU, region, category)
-- `Number` for numeric ranges (price, rating)
-- `Date` for date-based filtering (release date, expiration date)
-- `Boolean` for simple yes/no filters (isActive, inStock)
-- Do not include freeform text fields as structured columns — they should go in unstructured columns.
-
-### Selecting unstructured columns
-
-**Unstructured columns** support:
-
-- Full-text semantic search
-- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) queries
-
-Best practices:
-
-- Select columns containing rich text that will benefit from embedding:
-- Descriptions
-- Reviews
-- Policies
-- FAQ answers
-- Detailed notes
-- Avoid columns with redundant or trivial text — this can degrade search quality.
-- Be intentional about **how many** unstructured columns you define:
-- Too many dilute search results.
-- Too few limit context richness.
-
-### Example schema design
-
-#### Product catalog Hybrid KB
-
-**Structured columns:**
-
-- `SKU` (Text)
-- `Category` (Text)
-- `Price` (Number)
-- `AvailableSince` (Date)
-- `InStock` (Boolean)
-
-**Unstructured columns:**
-
-- `ProductName`
-- `Features`
-- `DetailedDescription`
-
-### Common pitfalls
-
-#### Mismatched column names
-
-- The column names you define **must match exactly** the column names in your source Library (CSV headers, Google Sheet columns).
-- Misspelled names or casing differences will cause ingestion errors.
-
-#### Poor type selection
-
-- Do not mark numeric fields as Text or vice versa.
-- Use Date types correctly to support proper date queries.
-
-#### Overloading structured columns
-
-- Do not add long freeform text columns as structured — this will degrade filtering performance.
-
-#### Underusing unstructured columns
-
-- If your unstructured text is spread across multiple columns (e.g., FAQ question, FAQ answer), consider combining them with a Structure before ingestion, or clearly select both as unstructured.
-
-## Example scenario
-
-You are designing a Hybrid Knowledge Base for your **Product Catalog**.
-
-Example configuration:
-
-- **Structured Columns**:
-- `SKU` (Text)
-- `Category` (Text)
-- `Price` (Number)
-- `AvailableSince` (Date)
-- **Unstructured Columns**:
-- `ProductName`
-- `DetailedDescription`
-
-Resulting queries supported:
-
-- Filter by `Category` and `Price` range.
-- Sort by `AvailableSince`.
-- Perform semantic search across product names and descriptions.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Incomplete search results
-
-- Verify that unstructured columns were selected and indexed correctly.
-- Check that structured filters in queries are not too restrictive.
-
-### Filter not working
-
-- Verify that the column was marked as structured and with the correct data type.
-- Check that the Library schema and column names match exactly.
-
-### Ingestion errors
-
-- Check that all column names match your source Library exactly.
-- Verify that the data types of columns align with your intended schema.

-
-## Complexity and time to complete
-
-- **Complexity**: Low.
-- **Estimated time**: 2–5 minutes per Knowledge Base.
-
-## Viewing existing Knowledge Bases
-
-1. Navigate to **Knowledge Bases** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
-2. The Knowledge Bases list view displays:
-
-- **Name**: User-defined name (example: `docs-temp-hcp`).
-- **Created**: Creation date and time.
-- **Updated**: Last updated date and time.
-- **Status**: Operational status (example: `Succeeded`).
-- **Type**: Backend type (example: `GenAI Builder Vector` or `vector`).
-
-3. Use pagination controls to navigate large lists (example: `Rows per page: 5 1-5 of 8 < >`).
-
-## Viewing Knowledge Base details
-
-1. Click on a Knowledge Base name or **View Details** icon to open its detail page.
-2. The detail view typically shows:
-
-- **Name** and **Description**
-- **Created** and **Updated** timestamps
-- **Status** and backend **Type**
-- **Linked Libraries** or **Data Sources**
-- **Indexing or sync status**
-- Recent activity or job history
-
-## Editing a Knowledge Base
-
-> **Note:** Edit capabilities may be limited after Knowledge Base creation, depending on type.
-
-1. In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Edit** action (typically from an actions menu or edit icon).
-2. You may be able to edit:
-
-- **Description**
-- In some cases, the set of Libraries or Data Sources (depends on type)
-- Configuration for Hybrid KB structured/unstructured columns (if supported)
-
-3. Save changes.
-
-## Refreshing or re-syncing a Knowledge Base
-
-1. In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Refresh** or **Re-sync** action.
-2. The system will:
-
-- Pull the latest data from linked Libraries.
-- Re-index the Knowledge Base if necessary.
-
-> Use this action when source Libraries have been updated and you want to propagate changes to the Knowledge Base.
-
-## Deleting a Knowledge Base
-
-> **Warning:** Deleting a Knowledge Base is irreversible. This will remove the Knowledge Base and its content from AI applications.
-
-1. In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Delete** action (typically from an actions menu or delete icon).
-2. Confirm the deletion when prompted.
-
-> This will not delete the source Libraries — only the Knowledge Base.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Knowledge Base status shows "Error" or "Failed"
-
-- Click **View Details** and check the activity log or job history.
-- If the Knowledge Base is linked to an external database (Self-Managed PG.AI Database), verify that the database connection is healthy.
-
-### Refresh operation does not update expected content
-
-- Verify that the linked Libraries have been refreshed and contain the latest data.
-- Re-run the Refresh / Re-sync action.
-- Check that Libraries are correctly configured with expected Data Sources and Transformations.
-
-### Cannot edit certain fields
-
-- Some Knowledge Base types (especially Fully-Managed Vector Stores and Self-Managed DBs) restrict editing of certain configuration fields after creation.
-- To change these fields, you may need to create a new Knowledge Base.
-
-## Example scenario
-
-You want to refresh and check the status of a Knowledge Base used in production:
-
-1. Navigate to **Knowledge Bases**.
-2. Locate `Company Policy KB`.
-3. Click **View Details** → confirm recent Libraries were updated.
-4. Click **Refresh** → re-sync the Knowledge Base.
-5. Monitor status until **Succeeded**.

-title: Define Repository Rules for Model Library
-navTitle: Define Repository Rules
-description: How to define and manage repository rules to control which model images appear in the Model Library.
----
-
-# Define Repository Rules for Model Library
-
-This guide explains how to define **Repository Rules** to control which model image repositories and tags from your connected registries appear in the AI Factory **Model Library**.
-
-Repository Rules help you manage:
-
-- **Scope** of image discovery
-- **Governance** over which images are exposed
-- **Version control** by controlling which tags are visible
-
-## Who should use this guide?
-
-- AI platform admins integrating private registries
-- DevOps engineers managing container registry integrations
-- Security/compliance teams governing AI model image usage
-
-## What this enables
-
-- You can precisely control which image repositories HCP syncs.
-- You can filter which tags within each repository are exposed.
-- You can govern which images are available in the Model Library for deployment.
-
-## Estimated time to complete
-
-5–10 minutes per Repository Rule.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- You must have already [Integrated your Private Registry](integrate-private-registry).
-- Your registry must appear in **AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories**.
-
-## Understanding Repository Rules
-
-Repository Rules are attached to each configured registry.
-
-They allow you to define:
-
-- **Which repositories** to discover
-- **Which tags** within those repositories to expose
-
-This prevents accidental exposure of test images, unvetted model builds, or entire registry contents.
-
-Repository Rules are **evaluated periodically** — newly pushed images matching the rule will appear in Model Library on the next sync.
-
-## How Repository Rules work
-
-Each rule typically includes:
-
-| Field | Description |
-|-------|-------------|
-| Repository Name | Name of the repository to include (exact match or pattern) |
-| Tag Filter | (Optional) Filter for tag names (exact match, prefix, regex) |
-| Rule Enabled | Whether this rule is currently active |
-
-Example:
-
-| Repository Name | Tag Filter |
-|-----------------|------------|
-| `my-company/llama3-models` | `^release-.*` |
-
-→ Only tags starting with `release-` in `my-company/llama3-models` will appear.
-
-## Defining Repository Rules
-
-### 1. Navigate to Repository Rules
-
-- Go to:
-
-`AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories`
-
-- Click **Manage Rules** for your desired registry.
-
-### 2. Add a Repository Rule
-
-- Click **Add Rule**.
-- Fill in:
-
-  - **Repository Name** — required
-  - **Tag Filter** — optional
-  - Enable/Disable toggle
-
-- Click **Save**.
-
-The rule will appear in the rules list.
-
-### 3. Wait for next sync or trigger manual sync
-
-HCP will apply rules on the next registry sync cycle.
-
-If your UI supports manual sync:
-
-- Click **Sync Now** after adding/updating a rule.
-
-### 4. Verify Model Library content
-
-- Go to **AI Factory > Model Library**.
-- Use filters to browse images from your registry.
-- Confirm only desired repositories/tags appear.
-
-## Example Use Cases
-
-### Basic: Restrict to a single repo
-
-| Repository Name | Tag Filter |
-|-----------------|------------|
-| `my-org/nim-models` | (blank — all tags) |
-
-→ All tags in `my-org/nim-models` will appear.
-
-### Advanced: Filter to production tags
-
-| Repository Name | Tag Filter |
-|-----------------|------------|
-| `models/gpt4` | `^prod-.*` |
-
-→ Only tags starting with `prod-` will appear.
-
-### Multi-repo governance
-
-- Add multiple Repository Rules per registry as needed.
-- Use Tag Filters to align with your model promotion pipelines (dev, staging, prod).
-
-## Tips & Best Practices
-
-- **Be explicit** — add Repository Rules for only the repositories you want to expose.
-- Use **Tag Filters** to enforce version governance and CI/CD promotion stages.
-- Regularly **audit Repository Rules** to ensure compliance with internal image standards.
-- If your registry uses structured tagging (e.g., `prod-`, `test-`), leverage Tag Filters to separate experimental from production models.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Images not appearing
-
-- Check that Repository Rule exists for the desired repo.
-- If using Tag Filter — verify tags match the filter exactly.
-- Check when the last sync ran; trigger manual sync if needed.
-
-### Too many images appearing
-
-- Refine Repository Rules.
-- Add Tag Filters to narrow scope.
-
-### Repository Rule has no effect
-
-- Confirm repository name is exact (case sensitive).
-- Ensure Rule is enabled.
-- Trigger manual sync and check HCP logs if issue persists.
-
-## Summary
-
-- Repository Rules govern which image repositories and tags appear in Model Library.
-- You can scope exposure by repository name and tag filters.
-- This supports governance, version control, and security best practices.
-- Fine-grained control helps ensure only vetted model images are deployed.

-title: How to Deploy AI Models from Model Library
-navTitle: Deploy AI Models
-description: Step-by-step guide to deploying AI models from the Model Library to Model Serving in Hybrid Control Plane.
----
-
-# How to Deploy AI Models from Model Library
-
-This guide explains how to deploy AI models from the AI Factory **Model Library** into Model Serving (powered by KServe) in your Hybrid Control Plane (HCP) environment.
-
-Once deployed, these models power key AI Factory features:
-
-- **Knowledge Bases** (via AIDB pipelines)
-- **Gen AI Builder Assistants and pipelines**
-- Other AI Factory and application integrations
-
-## Who should use this guide?
-
-- AI platform admins deploying validated model images
-- Data engineers configuring AI models for Knowledge Bases
-- AI application developers configuring models for Assistants
-
-## What this enables
-
-Once deployed:
-
-- Your AI models are available in Model Serving.
-- You can link them to Knowledge Bases or Gen AI Builder pipelines.
-- You can monitor and manage deployed models via the HCP Model Serving UI or Kubernetes.
-
-## Estimated time to complete
-
-10–20 minutes per model, depending on model size and cluster resources.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you begin:
-
-- An active HCP environment with **GPU worker nodes** configured.
-- NVIDIA NGC API key stored as `nvidia-nim-secrets` in Kubernetes.
-- The model image you want to deploy must be visible in the **Model Library**.
-- KServe must be configured and ready in your cluster.
-
-→ For a full setup guide, see: [Setup GPU Resources for Model Serving](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/learn-how/model-serving/setup-gpu)
-
-## Steps to deploy an AI model
-
-### 1. Browse and select model in Model Library
-
-- Go to **AI Factory > Model Library**.
-- Browse available model images.
-- Review versions and tags.
-- Select the version you want to deploy.
-
-### 2. Configure and deploy model
-
-- Click **Deploy** or **Deploy to Model Serving**.
-- Configure deployment parameters:
-
-  - Number of replicas
-  - Resource requests/limits (GPU, CPU, memory)
-  - Model runtime settings (if needed)
-
-- Confirm and deploy.
-
-This triggers creation of:
-
-- A `ClusterServingRuntime` for the model (if not already defined).
-- An `InferenceService` for the specific deployment.
-
-### 3. Verify deployed model
-
-You can verify your deployed models using:
-
-**Model Serving UI in HCP**
-
-- Go to **AI Factory > Model Serving** (or Hybrid Manager > AI Factory > Model Serving).
-- Confirm model appears with status **Ready**.
-
-Or use kubectl:
-kubectl get InferenceService -n default
-
-Example output:
-```NAME STATUS URL GPUs
-meta-nim-llama-3-3-nemotron-super-49b Ready http://meta-nim-llama-3-3-nemotron-super-49b-predictor... 4
-nim-snowflake-arctic-embed-l Ready http://nim-snowflake-arctic-embed-l-predictor... 1
-...
-```
-
-
-### 4. Connect model to AI Factory workloads
-
-Once the model is Ready:
-
-- You can select it in:
-
-  - Knowledge Base pipelines (for embedding or reranking)
-  - Gen AI Builder pipelines
-  - Assistant configurations
-
-→ The UI will show models available for each use case based on their **type** (Embedding, Completion, Reranking, etc.).
-
-## Supported model types
-
-| Model Type | Example Image |
-|------------|---------------|
-| Text Completion | llama-3.3-nemotron-super-49b |
-| Text Embedding | arctic-embed-l |
-| Image Embedding | nvclip |
-| OCR | paddleocr |
-| Text Reranker | llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2 |
-
-## Tips & Best Practices
-
-- **GPU placement**: Ensure your model matches your GPU capacity. Large models like **llama-3.3-49b** require multiple GPUs on a single node.
-- **Quota management**: Limit number of large models deployed simultaneously to avoid overloading GPU nodes.
-- **Version testing**: Test new model versions in isolated deployments before promoting to production pipelines or Assistants.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Model stuck in Pending
-
-- Check GPU node taints/labels.
-- Verify InferenceService tolerations and nodeSelectors match.
-
-### Model not appearing in Model Library
-
-- Confirm image is correctly tagged and synced via Image and Model Library.
-- Verify repository rules if using private registry.
-
-### Kubernetes errors on deploy
-
-- Check `kubectl describe InferenceService <model>` for detailed error logs.
-
-## Summary
-
-- You can deploy AI models from the AI Factory Model Library.
-- Deployed models run via KServe Model Serving.
-- Deployed models power Knowledge Bases and Gen AI Builder Assistants.
-- The deployment flow ensures consistent governance and visibility.

-description: How to connect a private container registry to the AI Factory Model Library to enable the use of your own model images.
----
-
-# Integrate Private Registry with Model Library
-
-This guide explains how to integrate your organization's **private container registry** with the AI Factory **Model Library**.
-
-Once integrated, your custom-built or internally-approved model images will appear in the Model Library UI, ready to deploy into Model Serving.
-
-## Who should use this guide?
-
-- AI platform admins responsible for container registry governance.
-- DevOps engineers managing private registries for AI images.
-- Developers needing to deploy private AI models through AI Factory.
-
-## What this enables
-
-- You can register private registries with Hybrid Control Plane (HCP).
-- HCP can discover AI model images in your registry.
-- These images will be available in the **Model Library** for deployment to Model Serving.
-- You can control visibility and usage of private model images across your AI Factory workloads.
-
-## Estimated time to complete
-
-10–15 minutes per registry configuration.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-Before you begin:
-
-- You must have admin access to your private container registry (AWS ECR, GCP GCR, Azure ACR, Harbor, or similar).
-- You must have admin access to HCP (to configure registry integration).
-- You must know the required credentials (username/password or token) for your registry.
-- Your registry must expose a compatible Docker Registry API v2 endpoint.
-
-## Supported registry types
-
-- AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
-- Google Container Registry (GCR) / Artifact Registry
-- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
-- Harbor
-- Generic registries supporting Docker Registry API v2
-
-## Integration Steps
-
-### 1. Prepare registry credentials
-
-- For public registries → no authentication required.
-- For private registries → prepare one of:
-
-  - Username/password pair
-  - Personal access token
-  - Robot account credentials (Harbor)
-
-Confirm you can perform a `docker pull` of your model images locally using these credentials.
-
-### 2. Register your registry in HCP
-
-- In the HCP UI, go to:
-
-`AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories > Add Registry`
-
-You will see a dialog prompting for:
-
-| Field | Description |
-|-------|-------------|
-| Registry URL | The full registry hostname (e.g., `myregistry.company.com`) |
-| Registry Type | Select from supported registry types |
-| Username | (Optional) Username for authentication |
-| Password/Token | (Optional) Password or token for authentication |
-| Registry Name (Label) | Friendly name displayed in Model Library UI |
-
-- Fill in the required fields.
-- Click **Add Registry**.
-
-### 3. Verify registry integration
-
-After adding:
-
-- HCP will attempt to connect to the registry and validate credentials.
-- If successful, your registry will appear in the **Manage Repositories** list.
-- HCP will begin periodic sync of repository tags from this registry.
-
-### 4. Define Repository Rules
-
-To control which repositories/tags are discovered:
-
-- After adding the registry, configure **Repository Rules**.
-- See: [Define Repository Rules for Model Library](define-repository-rules)
-
-### 5. Validate image availability
-
-After sync completes:
-
-- Go to **AI Factory > Model Library**.
-- Select the Registry scope or Repository filter.
-- Confirm your private model images appear with correct tags.
-
-You can now deploy these images via the normal **Deploy to Model Serving** flow.
-
-## Tips & Best Practices
-
-- Use **robot accounts** or **token-based auth** when possible to avoid exposing personal credentials.
-- Limit discovery scope via **Repository Rules** — avoid syncing the entire registry.
-- Tag images clearly with version info to aid selection in Model Library.
-- For multi-tenant environments, segment registry visibility carefully.
-
-## Troubleshooting
-
-### Registry connection failed
-
-- Check Registry URL (must not include `https://`, just the hostname).
-- Validate credentials by testing `docker login` manually.
-- Ensure Registry API v2 is enabled.
-
-### Images not appearing
-
-- Check that Repository Rules allow the relevant repository.
-- Verify image has a valid tag.
-- Confirm periodic sync has completed.
-
-### Authentication errors
-
-- For AWS ECR → ensure IAM permissions allow `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`.
-- For Azure ACR → ensure token has `acrPull` role.
-- For GCR → use a service account with Artifact Registry access.
-
-## Summary
-
-- You can integrate private registries with Model Library.
-- Your private model images become available to deploy via Model Serving.
-- You can govern visibility via Repository Rules.
-- Model Library unifies both public and private image sources for your AI workloads.

-# Manage Repository and Image Tag Metadata
-
-This guide explains how to manage metadata for your repositories and image tags in the Image and Model Library. Proper metadata helps you track, organize, and govern images used for AI model serving and Postgres cluster provisioning.
-
-## Who should use this guide?
-
-- Platform admins curating approved image sets.
-- DevOps teams tagging images for specific environments (Dev, Test, Prod).
-- AI/ML teams managing model lifecycle in AI Factory.
-- Security & compliance owners applying ownership metadata.
-
-## What this enables
-
-- Apply descriptive tags to repositories and image tags.
-- Edit READMEs for repositories for team guidance.
-- Track image ownership and promotion state.
-- Provide clear context to end users in Image Library UI.
-
-## Estimated time to complete
-
-5–10 minutes per repository/image.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- You have access to Image and Model Library in Hybrid Manager or AI Factory.
-- Your repository integration is already configured and image sync completed.
-- You have appropriate permissions to edit metadata.
-
-## Supported Metadata Features
-
-| Metadata Type | Applies To |
-|---------------|------------|
-| HCP Tags | Repository, Image Tag |
-| README | Repository |
-
-## Managing Repository Metadata
-
-### Apply HCP Tags to a Repository
-
-1. Navigate to Image and Model Library.
-2. Click on desired Repository (e.g. `postgresql`, `meta/llama-3.3`, `your-private-model-repo`).
-3. Click **Manage Tags** or **Edit Tags**.
-4. Add HCP Tags:
- - Example: `approved-production`, `beta`, `team-ml`, `archived`.
-5. Save changes.
-
-### Edit Repository README
-
-1. On the Repository page, click **Edit README**.
-2. Enter or update README content (supports Markdown).
- - Example sections:
-  - Purpose of repository.
-  - Model or DB image types contained.
-  - Support contacts.
-  - Security notes.
-3. Save README. It will now display on Repository details page.
-
-## Managing Image Tag Metadata
-
-### Apply HCP Tags to an Image Tag
-
-1. Navigate to Repository.
-2. Click **Image Tags** tab.
-3. For desired Image Tag, click **Manage Tags** or **Edit Tags**.
-4. Add HCP Tags:
- - Example: `approved-production`, `testing`, `deprecated`.
-5. Save changes.
-
-### Common Tag Usage Patterns
-
-| Tag Example | Usage |
-|-------------|-------|
-| `approved-production` | Images approved for Production use. |
-| `beta` | Images under evaluation. |
-| `team-ml` | Models used by ML team. |
-| `archived` | Images no longer in active use. |
-| `test-only` | Images used for testing / PoC deployments. |
-
-## Best Practices
-
-- Always apply `approved-production` only after full validation.
-- Clearly tag deprecated or archived images.
-- Use team-based tags (`team-ml`, `team-dba`) to indicate ownership.
-- Add README to every custom Repository — improves transparency.
-- Use Image Tags + HCP Tags for precise version tracking (ex: `postgresql:17.4-xxxx` tagged with `approved-production`).
-
-## Limitations & Notes
-
-- Applying Tags / README does not affect image pull or runtime behavior — they are for UI and governance.
-- Tags must follow naming conventions established in your org.
-- Currently HCP Tags do not propagate to private registry — they are stored in HCP metadata.
-
-## Example Workflow
-
-Scenario: ML team is preparing to move a new Reranker model into production.
-
-1. Team syncs model image `nv-rerankqa-1b-v2:1.8.2` into `private-model-repo`.
-2. After test validation:
- - Apply `approved-production` tag to this Image Tag.
- - Apply `team-ml` to Repository and Image Tag.
- - Edit Repository README to include model version history and ownership.
-3. Now AI Factory users can easily identify `approved-production` Reranker model.
-
-## Summary
-
-- You can manage HCP Tags and READMEs for Repositories and Image Tags.
-- This improves governance, tracking, and transparency.
-- Always tag Production-approved images clearly.
-- Keep READMEs updated for team guidance.

-
-# Configure a ClusterServingRuntime
-
-This guide explains how to configure a **ClusterServingRuntime** in KServe.
-A ClusterServingRuntime defines the environment used to serve your AI models — specifying container image, resource settings, environment variables, and supported model formats.
-
-For Hybrid Manager users, configuring runtimes is a core step toward enabling Model Serving — see [Model Serving in Hybrid Manager](../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/model-serving).
-
-## Goal
-
-Configure a ClusterServingRuntime so it can be used by InferenceServices to deploy models.
-
-## Estimated time
-
-5–10 minutes.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-- Define a ClusterServingRuntime YAML manifest.
-- Apply it to your Kubernetes cluster.
-- Enable reusable serving configuration for one or more models.
-
-## What this unlocks
-
-- Supports consistent deployment of models using a standard runtime definition.
-- Allows for centralized control over serving images and resource profiles.
-- Required step for deploying NVIDIA NIM containers with KServe.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- Kubernetes cluster with KServe installed.
-- Access to container image registry with the desired model server image.
-- NVIDIA GPU node pool configured (if using GPU-based models).
-- (If required) Kubernetes secret configured for API keys (e.g., NVIDIA NGC).
-
-For background concepts, see:
-
-- [Model Serving Explained](../../learn/explained-ai-factory-concepts#model-serving)
-- [AI Factory Terminology](../../learn/terminology#clusterservingruntime)
-
-## Steps
-
-### 1. Create ClusterServingRuntime YAML
-
-Create a file named `ClusterServingRuntime.yaml`.
-
-Example:
-
-apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1alpha1
-kind: ClusterServingRuntime
-metadata:
-name: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct-1.3.3
-namespace: default
-spec:
-containers:
-- env:
-- name: NIM_CACHE_PATH
-value: /tmp
-- name: NGC_API_KEY
-valueFrom:
-secretKeyRef:
-name: nvidia-nim-secrets
-key: NGC_API_KEY
-image: upmdev.azurecr.io/nim/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct:1.3.3
-name: kserve-container
-ports:
-- containerPort: 8000
-protocol: TCP
-resources:
-limits:
-cpu: "12"
-memory: 64Gi
-requests:
-cpu: "12"
-memory: 64Gi
-volumeMounts:
-- mountPath: /dev/shm
-name: dshm
-imagePullSecrets:
-- name: edb-cred
-protocolVersions:
-- v2
-- grpc-v2
-supportedModelFormats:
-- autoSelect: true
-name: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
-priority: 1
-version: "1.3.3"
-volumes:
-- emptyDir:
-medium: Memory
-sizeLimit: 16Gi
-name: dshm
-
-**Key fields explained:**
-
-- `containers.image`: The model server container (e.g., NVIDIA NIM image).
-- `resources`: CPU, memory, and GPU requirements.
-- `NGC_API_KEY`: Secret reference for NVIDIA models.
-- `supportedModelFormats`: Logical name used by InferenceService to reference this runtime.
-
-### 2. Apply the ClusterServingRuntime
-
-Run:
-
-kubectl apply -f ClusterServingRuntime.yaml
-
-### 3. Verify deployed ClusterServingRuntime
-
-Run:
-
-kubectl get ClusterServingRuntime
-
-Example:
-
-NAME                                     AGE
-nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct-1.3.3   1m
-
-You can inspect full details with:
-
-kubectl get ClusterServingRuntime <name> -o yaml
-
-### 4. Reference runtime in InferenceService
-
-When you create your InferenceService, reference this runtime:
-
-runtime: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct-1.3.3
-modelFormat:
-name: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
-
-See [Deploy an NVIDIA NIM container with KServe](./deploy-nim-container).
-
-## Notes
-
-- Runtimes are reusable — you can deploy multiple models referencing the same ClusterServingRuntime.
-- Use meaningful names and version fields in `supportedModelFormats` for traceability.
-- You can update a runtime by editing and re-applying the YAML.
-
-## Next steps

-
-# Create an InferenceService for NVIDIA NIM Container
-
-This How-To explains how to deploy an NVIDIA NIM container as an InferenceService using KServe on Kubernetes.
-
-You will define and apply an `InferenceService.yaml` manifest that references an existing ClusterServingRuntime and runs a GPU-accelerated model instance.
-
-This is a core step to making your model available for inference through a network-accessible endpoint.
-
-## Goal
-
-Deploy an InferenceService for an NVIDIA NIM container using KServe.
-
-## Estimated time
-
-10–15 minutes.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-- Define an InferenceService manifest.
-- Deploy the InferenceService to your Kubernetes cluster.
-- Make the model available via a network endpoint.
-
-## What this unlocks
-
-Once deployed, your model can be consumed by applications (such as Gen AI Builder agents) via standard inference APIs.
-It will also appear in your KServe monitoring and can be scaled or updated dynamically.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- Kubernetes cluster with KServe installed and configured.
-- ClusterServingRuntime configured for your NIM container.
-See [Configure ClusterServingRuntime](./configure-serving-runtime).
-- GPU-enabled node pool provisioned and labeled appropriately.
-- NVIDIA NGC API key stored as Kubernetes secret, if required.
-- The desired NIM container image available in your registry.
-
-## Steps
-
-### 1. Create InferenceService manifest
-
-Create a file named `InferenceService.yaml` with the following content:
-
-apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
-kind: InferenceService
-metadata:
-annotations:
-serving.kserve.io/enable-prometheus-scraping: "true"
-prometheus.kserve.io/port: "8000"
-prometheus.kserve.io/path: "/v1/metrics"
-name: llama-3-1-8b-instruct-1xgpu-g5
-namespace: default
-spec:
-predictor:
-tolerations:
-- key: nvidia.com/gpu
-operator: Exists
-effect: NoSchedule
-nodeSelector:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "true"
-imagePullSecrets:
-- name: edb-cred
-model:
-modelFormat:
-name: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct
-resources:
-limits:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
-requests:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
-runtime: nvidia-nim-llama-3.1-8b-instruct-1.3.3
-
-Key points:
-
-- **name** → provide a unique name for your InferenceService.
-- **tolerations** and **nodeSelector** → must match your GPU node pool configuration.
-- **runtime** and **modelFormat** → must match the values used in your ClusterServingRuntime.
-- **GPU resources** → specify the number of GPUs to allocate.
-
-### 2. Apply the InferenceService
-
-Run:
-
-kubectl apply -f InferenceService.yaml
-
-### 3. Verify the deployment
-
-Check the InferenceService status:
-
-kubectl get InferenceService -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,MODEL:.spec.predictor.model.modelFormat.name,URL:.status.address.url,RUNTIME:.spec.predictor.model.runtime,GPUs:.spec.predictor.model.resources.limits.nvidia\\.com/gpu --namespace=default
-
-You should see:
-
-- The name of your InferenceService.
-- The model format being served.
-- The endpoint URL.
-- The ClusterServingRuntime used.
-- The number of GPUs allocated.
-
-## What’s next
-
-Now that your model is deployed:
-
-- Your application (or Gen AI Builder agent) can send inference requests to the provided URL.
-- You can monitor model performance and resource usage.
-- You can update the GPU allocation or other runtime parameters if needed.

-description: Frequently Asked Questions about using Model Serving in AI Factory with KServe.
----
-
-# Model Serving FAQ
-
-Here are answers to common questions about using Model Serving with AI Factory.
-
-## What models are currently supported?
-
-AI Factory Model Serving (version 1.2) supports deploying models packaged as **NVIDIA NIM containers** using KServe.
-
-Support for deploying additional model types and formats will be expanded in future releases. See the [Supported Models Index](../../models/supported-models/index) for the latest information.
-
-## What Kubernetes resources are used for serving models?
-
-Models are served using [KServe InferenceServices](https://kserve.github.io/website/), which manage the lifecycle of model-serving pods.
-
-Supporting KServe resources such as ServingRuntimes and related GPU-configured Kubernetes nodes are also used.
-
-## What hardware is required?
-
-NIM-based model serving requires **GPU-enabled Kubernetes nodes**.
-
-Refer to the [GPU setup guide](../model-serving/update-gpu-resources) for supported configurations and node recommendations by cloud provider.
-
-## Can I deploy custom models?
-
-At this time, AI Factory Model Serving is optimized for **NIM-based containers**. Support for deploying arbitrary models via KServe is planned, but requires manual configuration outside of the current AI Factory streamlined flow.
-
-## How is scaling handled?
-
-KServe InferenceServices use **Kubernetes-native scaling**, with auto-scaling supported for compatible runtimes.
-
-Scaling behavior can be configured in the InferenceService specification (replicas, resources).
-
-## How do I monitor running models?
-
-You can monitor deployed models using:
-
-- **KServe InferenceService status**
-- Kubernetes monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, etc.)
-- [Model Serving Monitoring Guide](./monitor-inferenceservice)
-
-## Where can I learn more about the model serving architecture?
-
-See:
-
-- [Model Serving Explained](../../learn/explained/model-serving-explained)
-- [AI Factory Concepts](../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts#model-serving-kserve)

----
-
-# Monitor deployed models with KServe
-
-This guide explains how to monitor deployed AI models using KServe on Kubernetes.
-
-Monitoring your models helps ensure reliability, performance, and optimal use of resources — whether you are working in general Kubernetes or using Hybrid Manager AI Factory.
-
-For AI Factory users, Hybrid Manager will provide additional value-add monitoring and observability features — see [Model Serving in Hybrid Manager](../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/model-serving).
-
-## Goal
-
-Monitor deployed models, check model status and serving endpoints, and retrieve resource usage information.
-
-## Estimated time
-
-5–10 minutes.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-- List deployed InferenceServices (models).
-- Retrieve model endpoint and runtime details.
-- Understand how to observe model performance.
-- Prepare to integrate model metrics into observability pipelines.
-
-## What this unlocks
-
-- Confidence that models are correctly deployed and serving.
-- Ability to troubleshoot or scale model deployments.
-- Foundation for using Hybrid Manager AI Factory observability for model serving.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- Deployed InferenceService on KServe.
-- ClusterServingRuntime defined.
-- kubectl configured for your Kubernetes cluster.
-
-For background concepts, see:
-
-- [Model Serving Explained](../../learn/explained-ai-factory-concepts#model-serving)
-- [AI Factory Terminology](../../learn/terminology#model-serving)
-
-## Steps
-
-### 1. List deployed InferenceServices
-
-To list deployed models and see key details:
-
-kubectl get InferenceService \
--o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,MODEL:.spec.predictor.model.modelFormat.name,URL:.status.address.url,RUNTIME:.spec.predictor.model.runtime,GPUs:.spec.predictor.model.resources.limits.nvidia\\.com/gpu \
---namespace=default
-
-Key columns:
-
-- **NAME**: Name of the InferenceService.
-- **MODEL**: Model format name (from ClusterServingRuntime).
-- **URL**: Service endpoint for inference requests.
-- **RUNTIME**: ClusterServingRuntime used.
-- **GPUs**: Number of GPUs allocated.
-
-### 2. Retrieve runtime details
-
-To view ClusterServingRuntime details, including serving port and resource allocations:
-
-kubectl get ClusterServingRuntimes \
--o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,IMAGE:.spec.containers[0].image,PORT:.spec.containers[0].ports[0].containerPort,CPUs:.spec.containers[0].resources.limits.cpu,MEMORY:.spec.containers[0].resources.limits.memory \
---namespace=all-namespaces
-
-Key columns:
-
-- **NAME**: Name of the runtime.
-- **IMAGE**: Model server image used.
-- **PORT**: Inference port (commonly 8000 for NIM).
-- **CPUs**: CPU resources allocated.
-- **MEMORY**: Memory allocated.
-
-### 3. Observe model metrics
-
-If you enabled Prometheus scraping via InferenceService annotations:
-
-- serving.kserve.io/enable-prometheus-scraping: "true"
-
-Then Prometheus can scrape metrics at:
-
-/v1/metrics on port 8000 of the model service.
-
-Metrics typically include:
-
-- **Request latency**
-- **Throughput (requests per second)**
-- **Error rates**
-- **GPU utilization (if GPUs used)**
-
-You can visualize these metrics in tools such as **Grafana**.
-
-### 4. Check pod status
-
-For debugging, you can also view model pods directly:
-
-kubectl get pods --namespace=default
-
-Look for pods with names matching:
-
-`<inference-service-name>-predictor-*`
-
-Check pod status and logs if needed:
-
-kubectl logs <pod-name> --namespace=default
-

-# Observability for Model Serving
-
-Observability helps you ensure that your deployed AI models are running efficiently and reliably within AI Factory.
-
-Model Serving in AI Factory uses KServe on Kubernetes to serve models. This provides built-in options to monitor:
-
-- Model serving status and availability
-- Resource usage (CPU, Memory, GPU)
-- Inference performance and throughput
-
----
-
-## Key monitoring capabilities
-
-### KServe InferenceService status
-
-You can inspect model serving status directly via Kubernetes:
-
-kubectl get inferenceservice -n <namespace>
-
-Common status fields include:
-
-- Ready / NotReady
-- URL endpoint
-- Current replicas
-- Allocated resources (GPU, CPU, Memory)
-
-For detailed inspection:
-
-kubectl describe inferenceservice <name> -n <namespace>
-
----
-
-### GPU utilization monitoring
-
-If your models are deployed on GPU nodes, monitor GPU usage to optimize resource allocation.
-
-Example:
-
-kubectl top node
-
-For deeper GPU-specific metrics (if supported):
-
-nvidia-smi
-
----
-
-### Prometheus and Grafana integration
-
-If Prometheus is configured, AI Factory model serving exposes metrics through KServe:
-
-Prometheus annotations to enable scraping:
-
-serving.kserve.io/enable-prometheus-scraping: "true"
-prometheus.kserve.io/port: "8000"
-prometheus.kserve.io/path: "/v1/metrics"
-
-You can build Grafana dashboards to monitor:
-
-- Inference requests per second
-- Latency and error rates
-- GPU utilization trends
-- Pod restarts and health
-
----
-
-### Logs and debugging
-
-You can access detailed logs from model serving pods:
-
-kubectl logs -f <pod-name> -n <namespace>
-
-Use logs to:
-
-- Debug model loading or initialization issues
-- Review inference request behavior
-- Monitor response handling and error conditions
-
----
-
-## Hybrid Manager observability integration
-
-When running AI Factory in conjunction with Hybrid Manager (HCP), you can integrate model serving observability into the broader HCP observability stack.
-
-See [Hybrid Manager Model Serving Observability](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/verify-models) for additional guidance on using HCP observability tools with Model Serving.
-
----
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Enable Prometheus scraping on InferenceServices for production.
-- Regularly monitor GPU usage to optimize capacity.
-- Set proper resource requests/limits in InferenceService specs.
-- Leverage Grafana dashboards for real-time observability.
-- Use log inspection to support debugging and tuning.

----
-
-# Update GPU Resources for an InferenceService
-
-This How-To explains how to adjust the number of GPUs allocated to an existing InferenceService deployed with KServe.
-This allows you to scale your model deployment dynamically without redeploying from scratch.
-
-## Goal
-
-Change the GPU resource allocation (number of GPUs) for a deployed InferenceService.
-
-## Estimated time
-
-5 minutes.
-
-## What you will accomplish
-
-- Edit an existing InferenceService resource.
-- Apply updated GPU resource limits and requests.
-- Trigger KServe to redeploy the model container with new GPU settings.
-
-## What this unlocks
-
-Enables dynamic scaling of GPU resources to optimize performance and cost:
-
-- Increase GPUs for faster response time and higher throughput.
-- Reduce GPUs when demand is lower to save resources.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- An InferenceService already deployed using KServe.
-See [Create InferenceService for NVIDIA NIM Container](./create-inferenceservice).
-- GPU-enabled node pool available in your Kubernetes cluster.
-
-## Steps
-
-### 1. Edit the InferenceService
-
-Run:
-
-kubectl edit InferenceService <your-inferenceservice-name>
-
-Example:
-
-kubectl edit InferenceService llama-3-1-8b-instruct-1xgpu-g5
-
-### 2. Update GPU resource settings
-
-Locate this section:
-
-spec:
-predictor:
-model:
-resources:
-limits:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
-requests:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "1"
-
-Change both **limits** and **requests** to the desired number of GPUs.
-Example to scale to 4 GPUs:
-
-spec:
-predictor:
-model:
-resources:
-limits:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "4"
-requests:
-nvidia.com/gpu: "4"
-
-Save and close the editor.
-
-### 3. Verify the updated GPU allocation
-
-Run:
-
-kubectl get InferenceService -o custom-columns=NAME:.metadata.name,MODEL:.spec.predictor.model.modelFormat.name,URL:.status.address.url,RUNTIME:.spec.predictor.model.runtime,GPUs:.spec.predictor.model.resources.limits.nvidia\\.com/gpu --namespace=default
-
-Confirm that the **GPUs** column reflects your updated setting.
-
-KServe will automatically redeploy the InferenceService with the new configuration.

----
-
-# How Model Serving Deployment Works
-
-AI Factory makes it easy to deploy your AI models as scalable, production-ready inference services. The platform uses **KServe** as the model serving engine, operating within the Hybrid Manager (HCP) Kubernetes infrastructure.
-
-This page explains the general flow of model deployment and links to key how-to guides for hands-on instructions.
-
----
-
-## Deployment flow overview
-
-- You deploy models by creating **KServe InferenceServices** in your HCP project.
-- AI Factory provides **GPU-enabled Kubernetes infrastructure** to run these services.
-- You can deploy supported **NVIDIA NIM containers** or other compatible models.
-- The **Model Library** helps you discover and manage model images.
-- Applications access model endpoints over **HTTP** or **gRPC** APIs.
-
----
-
-## Deployment components
-
-### KServe InferenceService
-
-Each model is deployed via a Kubernetes-native `InferenceService` object:
-
-- Manages lifecycle of the model server pods.
-- Handles scaling, health checks, and routing.
-- Exposes a network endpoint for model consumption.
-
-### ClusterServingRuntime
-
-Advanced users can also configure `ClusterServingRuntime` resources to customize runtime environments for their models.
-
----
-
-## Where to start
-
-If you're ready to deploy models, follow these guides:
-
-- [Deploy NIM Containers](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/deploy-nim-container)
-- [Create InferenceService](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/create-inferenceservice)
-- [Configure ServingRuntime](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/configure-servingruntime)
-- [Monitor InferenceService](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/monitor-inferenceservice)
-- [Update GPU Resources](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/update-gpu-resources)
-
----
-
-## Hybrid Manager integration
-
-Model Serving runs on **Hybrid Manager (HCP)** Kubernetes clusters. For more on Hybrid Manager and GPU setup:
-
-- [Setting Up GPU Resources in Hybrid Manager](../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/setup-gpu)
-- [Verifying Model Deployment in Hybrid Manager](../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/verify-models)
-
----
-
-## Best practices
-
-- Use the Model Library to select supported models.
-- Verify that your cluster has sufficient GPU resources.
-- Monitor deployed models to ensure performance and availability.
-- Use `ClusterServingRuntime` where advanced customization is needed.
-
----
-
-## Next steps
-
-- Explore our [Model Serving How-To Guides](../../../learn/how-to/model-serving/index)
-- Review supported models in the [Supported Models Index](../../../models/supported-models/index)
-- Learn about [Observability for Model Serving](./observability)
-
----
-
-By following this deployment flow, you can run AI models in production with full observability and scale — directly integrated with the broader AI Factory and Hybrid Manager ecosystem.

-
-KServe operates within the managed Hybrid Manager (HCP) Kubernetes infrastructure provided by AI Factory, giving you access to scalable, GPU-accelerated model serving.
-
-For a deeper understanding of the model serving architecture, see [KServe in AI Factory concepts](../learn/explained-ai-factory-concepts#model-serving-kserve).
-
----
-
-## How Model Serving works
-
-- Models are deployed as KServe InferenceServices within your HCP project.
-- AI Factory provides GPU-enabled Kubernetes infrastructure to run these services.
-- The HCP Model Library helps you discover and manage supported models.
-- Your applications can consume model endpoints using standard HTTP or gRPC APIs.

-title: Container Registry Integration
-navTitle: Container Registry Integration
-description: Understand how the Hybrid Control Plane Image and Model Library integrates with container registries to provide database and AI model images.
----
-
-# Container Registry Integration
-
-The Image and Model Library in Hybrid Control Plane (HCP) is powered by container registries.
-Registries provide the actual image content for:
-
-- **Database images** (PostgreSQL, EPAS, PGE)
-- **AI model images** (NVIDIA NIM, future custom models)
-
-Understanding how container registry integration works is key to managing and extending your Image Library.
-
----
-
-## How does it work?
-
-HCP relies on the **PGAI agent** to pull image metadata from connected registries.
-
-The PGAI agent uses **Repository Rules** to know:
-
-- Which registries to connect to
-- Which repositories to scan
-- Which image tags to import
-
-→ The Image Library UI in HCP is a reflection of what the agent has pulled.
-
----
-
-## Key Concepts
-
-| Concept | Meaning |
-|---------|---------|
-| **Registry** | A container registry (ex: Azure ACR, AWS ECR, GCP GCR, private registry) |
-| **Repository** | A collection of images for a given software or model (ex: `postgresql`, `meta/llama-3.3-49b`) |
-| **Tag** | A version of an image (ex: `17.4-2503310734`, `1.8.5`, `latest`) |
-| **Repository Rule** | A rule that tells the PGAI agent which repositories/tags to discover |
-| **HCP Tags** | Organizational tags within HCP → these are separate from registry tags |
-
----
-
-## Default registries
-
-In ephemeral HCP environments:
-
-- Default registry is `upmdev.azurecr.io` (Azure ACR).
-- Repositories:
-- `postgresql` → PostgreSQL community images.
-- `edb-postgres-advanced` → EPAS images.
-- `edb-postgres-extended` → PGE images.
-
-In customer environments:
-
-- Customer provides a **private registry**.
-- Image Library is configured to pull from that registry.
-
----
-
-## Repository Rules
-
-Repository Rules drive what the PGAI agent discovers:
-
-- You can add **custom repositories** via Image Library UI → "Manage Repositories."
-- You can edit the PGAI agent config for advanced control.
-
-Example agent config section:
-
-```yaml
-dispatcher:
-  capabilities:
-    provisioning:
-      images:
-        discovery:
-          registry:
-            postgres_repositories:
-              - name: postgresql
-                description: Community PostgreSQL
-              - name: edb-postgres-advanced
-                description: EPAS
-              - name: edb-postgres-extended
-                description: PGE
-              - name: postgresql-torsten
-                description: Custom PG Build with AIDB
-```
-This tells agent which repositories to pull and display.
-
-→ You can edit this config to add more repositories (advanced).
-
-Private Registry Integration Flow
-Add repository via Image Library UI → simplest flow for most users.
-
-Agent pulls image list periodically.
-
-Image tags and metadata appear in Image Library.
-
-You can select these images for:
-
-Database provisioning
-
-AI model serving (via Model Library in AI Factory).
-
-Relationship to AI Factory Model Library
-Model Library in AI Factory is powered by Image Library.
-
-All AI model images flow through this same registry → agent pull → Image Library → available for Model Serving.
-
-This ensures consistent governance of all model images.
-
-→ See: AI Factory Model Serving Explained
-Summary
-* Registries provide the source of truth for images.
-* Repository Rules tell HCP which repos/tags to scan.
-* PGAI agent pulls the images and updates Image Library UI.
-* Private registries can be fully integrated and governed.
-* AI Factory Model Library leverages this same system.

-navTitle: Image and Model Library Explained
-description: Understand the Image and Model Library in HCP, powering both database images and AI model images through a unified architecture.
----
-
-# Image and Model Library Explained
-
-The **Image and Model Library** is a core capability of the Hybrid Control Plane (HCP).
-It provides a unified, governed repository for managing container images across your entire HCP environment.
-
-This includes:
-
-- **Database images** → for PostgreSQL cluster provisioning.
-- **AI model images** → for Model Serving (via AI Factory Model Library).
-
-## Why a single library?
-
-Using a unified Image and Model Library ensures:
-
-- **Governance** → all images (DB or AI model) pass through the same approval flow.
-- **Consistency** → the same agent-driven sync pulls images from container registries.
-- **Security** → private registry integration applies equally to all image types.
-- **Flexibility** → both database and AI teams can manage images within a common framework.
-
----
-
-## What is the difference between Image Library and Model Library?
-
-| Capability | Image and Model Library (Hub) | Model Library (AI Factory) |
-|------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
-| Scope | All container images used in HCP | Subset: AI model images used for Model Serving |
-| Primary Users | DB admins, platform teams, AI teams | AI Factory users, AI engineers |
-| Backed by Container Registry? | Yes | Yes (via Image Library) |
-| Supports Private Registries? | Yes | Yes (via Image Library) |
-| Source of Truth | Container Registry → Image Library | Filtered view of Image Library |
-| Usage | Postgres cluster provisioning, AI model serving | AI model serving only |
-| UI Location | Image Library (HCP Portal) | Model Library (AI Factory UI) |
-
-**Summary:**
-→ The Model Library is powered by Image Library.
-→ All images pass through Image Library first → Model Library presents a user-friendly view of AI model images.
-
----
-
-## Architecture flow
-
-```
-Container Registry → Image and Model Library →
-→ Postgres Provisioning / AI Model Serving
-→ Model Library UI → Model Serving
-```
-
-* Postgres provisioning consumes database images from Image Library.
-
-* AI Factory Model Library consumes model images → curated from Image Library.
-
-
-
-
-Key Concepts
-Concept	Meaning
-Repository	A collection of images (ex: postgresql, meta/llama-3.3-49b)
-Tag	A version of an image (ex: 17.4-2503310734, 1.8.5, latest)
-HCP Tags	Organizational tags applied to image repos in HCP
-Repository Rules	Define which repos/tags to sync from connected registries

----
-
-# Setup GPU resources in Hybrid Manager
-
-Use this guide to prepare GPU resources in your Hybrid Manager (HCP) Kubernetes cluster to support Model Serving with KServe.
-
-You provision GPU-enabled nodes, configure them for KServe, and store required secrets for deploying NVIDIA NIM models.
-
-## Goal
-
-Prepare your HCP cluster to run GPU-based Model Serving workloads using KServe.
-
-## Estimated time
-
-20–40 minutes (provisioning might take longer depending on your cloud provider).
-
-## What you accomplish
-
-- Provision GPU node groups or node pools in your HCP cluster.
-- Label and taint GPU nodes correctly.
-- Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet.
-- Store your NVIDIA API key as a Kubernetes secret.
-- Enable your cluster to run NIM model containers in KServe.
-
-## What this unlocks
-
-After you complete this procedure, you can deploy supported GPU-accelerated models through Model Serving:
-
-- For AIDB Knowledge Bases.
-- For GenAI Builder assistants.
-- For custom model-based applications.
-
-## Prerequisites
-
-- Access to an HCP Kubernetes cluster with appropriate permissions.
-- Administrative access to provision node groups (AWS EKS / GCP GKE / RHOS).
-- NVIDIA API key for accessing NIM models.
-- Familiarity with basic `kubectl` usage.
-
-## Provision GPU nodes
-
-Provision GPU node groups (EKS) or node pools (GKE / RHOS) in your HCP cluster:
-
-- Use instances with L40S or A100 GPUs (for example, `g6e.12xlarge` on AWS or `a2-highgpu-4g` on GCP).
-- Recommended: Provision at least one node with four GPUs to support large models such as Llama 70B.
-
-See [HCP validated GPU configurations](../ai-factory/model-serving/gpu).
-
-## Label and taint GPU nodes
-
-Apply the following Kubernetes label and taint to GPU nodes.
-
-Label:
-
-```shell
-kubectl label node <gpu-node-name> nvidia.com/gpu=true
-````
-
-Taint:
-
-```shell
-kubectl taint nodes <gpu-node-name> nvidia.com/gpu=true:NoSchedule
-```
-
-This ensures that KServe model pods are scheduled correctly and that Postgres clusters do not land on GPU nodes.
-
-## Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin
-
-Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet.
-
-```shell
-kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.14.1/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
-```
-
-Verify that the plugin is running.
-
-```shell
-kubectl get ds -n kube-system nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset
-```
-
-The plugin exposes GPU resources to Kubernetes and KServe.
-
-## Store NVIDIA API key as Kubernetes secret
-
-Generate an NVIDIA API key from the NGC Catalog portal.
-
-Create a Kubernetes secret.
-
-```shell
-kubectl create secret generic nvidia-nim-secrets --from-literal=NGC_API_KEY=<your_NVIDIA_API_KEY>
-```
-
-This secret is required when deploying `ClusterServingRuntime` resources for NIM models.
